                "Just as a Nintendo 64 without \"Super Mario 64\" was unthinkable, so too is a Wii without Wii Sports. It’s one of the most perfect launch games we’ve seen.", 
                "In terms of control and immersion, Wii Sports destroys the competition and provides an excellent foundation for other developers to build upon.", 
                "Wii Sports is the perfect pack-in for the Wii since it really shows off the system’s unique capabilities and manages to draw in casual gamers who would otherwise not want to play videogames.", 
                "The game does a great job of showing off what the system is about and showcasing the system’s abilities.", 
                "We can't help but enjoy the fact that we're getting a solid sports experience for nothing. It's definitely more fun in groups and won't have a great deal of longevity, but anyone who doesn't find at least some fun in Wii Sports has a heart of coal.", 
                "Sure, it lacks goals and can be beaten very quickly. But the ultra-responsive technology and high multiplayer replay value are far greater than any other party or sports game collection.", 
                "The single-player game is good for practice and daily tests, but Wii Sports shines as a multiplayer game. [Jan. 2007, p.96]", 
                "It's bloody good fun and you'll enjoy playing it for ages. [January 2007, p.38]", 
                "It's a game you can play with your friends and family, and it perfectly highlights the direction that Nintendo is taking with the platform. It's not the best-looking game on the system, and it's definitely not the deepest, but it may well be the most fun.", 
                "This is a simple game about simple fun, and everyone owes it to themselves to try it out to get a taste for what the Wii may in fact have in store for us all very soon.", 
                "A couple of the games are rewarding for the long term, but most can be easily whipped into submission in a matter of hours. The visuals are also severely lacking.", 
                "Wii Sports certainly won't be hailed as the most realistic sports sim on the market, but it's the best thing - next to a bottle of tequila - to take to a friend's holiday house party.", 
                "The game's meant to be a no-frills, no-pressure entry point into the Wii and its bizarre new way of playing videogames, and it's impressive that it manages to be a lot of fun at the same time.", 
                "More fun than a box of ferrets and almost genius, but it feels just a bit too slapdash. [Christmas 2006, p.64]", 
                "It may not win any awards for the best looking or sounding game but it's great pure fun, and is instantly accessible to pretty much anyone.", 
                "Brilliantly embodies the Wii's dramatic premise: that this kind of control can appeal to people who don't play games and people who used to play games as well as people who've been playing them for as long as we have.", 
                "Despite the shortcomings in presentation and pruning in some aspects of the modes and play, what Wii Sports gets right it gets right with flying colors, showing that what may have appeared as a gimmick - the motion-reading controllers - is actually a revolution.", 
                "Highly approachable and hugely entertaining for all ages, Wii Sports serves as a great introduction and advertisement for the innovative Wii motion-sensing controller.", 
                "It’s simple, addictive, compelling and innovative all rolled into one.", 
                "It’s accessible, addictive, and an excellent tech-demo for the Wii-mote, not to mention an obvious choice to whip out when you want to show off your new purchase.", 
                "A massive, massive success as a launch title. Ignore the negativity you may have heard, and embrace this marvellous new bit of kit into your home.", 
                "Wii Sports makes for an ideal pack-in with Nintendo's new console, providing some fun, simple gameplay that's accessible to almost anyone.", 
                "For a free game that’s included with the system, we couldn’t be happier. We hope that Nintendo expands on the Bowling, Baseball, and Tennis games and tweaks Golf for future releases because they have a real winner on their hands.", 
                "With the exception of Boxing, everything in Wii Sports is entertaining, and there's a little more depth than the simplistic presentation might lead you to believe.", 
                "Despite these two solo modes, Wii Sports is really all about getting some friends together and playing a few matches of tennis or bowling. The game isn't designed to be a true authentic sports simulation, it's all about the sheer entertainment value, and this is where Wii Sports really shines.", 
                "Your non-gamer friends will be dazzled by the immediately intuitive controls and the imported Miis. But the title sacrifices incredible depth and visuals for an immediately accessible experience.", 
                "The bottom line, really, is that Wii Sports, as a multiplayer game, is downright fun. Whether your thing is tennis, baseball, golf, bowling or boxing, you’re bound to be smiling - at least for a few seconds - while playing Wii Sports.", 
                "If I had to pay for them, I probably wouldn't, but as a freebie included with the system, they're great for showcasing the system's capabilities and give all of the people in your household a chance to game — even those with no previous experience!", 
                "Create your Mii and challenge your friends (both gaming and non-gaming) to a game of bowling. I guarantee they’ll be hooked and so will you.", 
                "A very solid first effort for the Wii, and provides just a taste of what is, and what will be, great about the Wii console. Pick it up, play it and have fun. Very nice.", 
                "This is one you can feel confident about showing your family and friends who are normally saying things like \"pish-tosh\" when you bring up video games.", 
                "Wii Sports is all about showing what Nintendo's newest console an do in terms of innovation and making gaming accessible to everyone and overall it does a great job of this.", 
                "For the hardcore there’s not much here that you’ll be playing for more than an hour other than the training mode which gives you a lot of challenges but ultimately falls flat.", 
                "While the game isn’t exactly deep, who cares? It’s free and it’s fun; and that’s all that matters.", 
                "Who needs the outside world when you can get some decent exercise in your very living room or bedroom? It may not be anything rigorous, but it'll get your body moving in ways that it normally may not.", 
                "This glorified tech demo is an excellent game for groups, whether the serious gamers you'd expect from a college dorm or the kids at a family reunion.", 
                "Perfect? No. Indispensable? Yes. Wii Sports more than earns its bundled place as an essential component of the hardware. [Christmas 2006, p.76]", 
                "Wii Sports is neither bulging in features nor graphically impressive, but when you put everything together, you have a fun package that, although better in places than others, is varied enough to keep you entertained for a good while and brilliant in multiplayer.", 
                "In Wii Sports, innovation and gameplay triumph over substance, graphics, and depth, a feat which only Nintendo could accomplish.", 
                "Still, as a pack-in, it's hard to take pot-shots at a game that so perfectly acclimates users to the new control. [Jan. 2007, p.76]", 
                "Gamestyle still has concerns over the longevity of what could be a glorified Wiimote training session; but we were surprised at how much fun is here for the short term at least. It’s shallow, yet immensely playable, and a great introduction to this revolutionary system.", 
                "You can’t expect too much from a pack-in game, and Wii Sports is no exception. While it’s true that you will probably have a good time with one or two of the activities presented on this disc, it’s just as likely that you’ll get bored of them after only a few plays and never touch them again.", 
                "It gives gamers a small taste of what the WiiMote can do for their gaming experiences and a reason to keep playing the new system, but nothing more. Its appeal and flaws lay with its simplicity.", 
                "As a demo that gives a glimpse into the Wii's gaming future, Wii Sports is reassuring, charming, and good, clean fun.", 
                "None of these sports are fully fleshed out, and they simply represent a range of motions to perform with the controller.", 
                "The greatest strength of Wii Sports—its unparalleled accessibility—ends up being its greatest weakness. Although the game initially feels like a breath of fresh air, the failure of its novel control scheme to provide the sensitivity needed for continued growth and mastery ultimately sucks much of that air right back out.", 
                "I like the concept behind this pack-in, but Wii Sports simply ends up being an overly publicized demo. [Jan. 2007, p.63]", 
                "Despite control issues Wii Sports is probably one of the only launch titles that offers so much fun from such a small package.", 
                "In its 'free' state, Wii Sports is a triumph when presenting the abilities of your new console, but in reality, it's an extended victory for the console itself and not praise that should be bestowed upon the game. [Christmas 2006, p.106]"

Boxing is mediocre because the controls seem inconsistent when trying to pull off anything but the jabs. Strangely enough, boxing is the game that everyone that has played with me loves the most - one person even said that it was a good workout! Tennis is good, but it's also pretty easy. Bowling is really really fun, basically because it's just like real bowling. Since I only have one wii-mote it's the only game that I can play multiplayer with my friends (golf too, but... no). But what is giving me the most replay value is the fitness test. Strangely enough, the fact that you're limited to do it once a day entices me to do it even more! All in all, single player value comes from the tennis regular game, the fitness test, and a few of the training games. Multiplayer replay value comes from bowling and perhaps boxing.… Expand",

Looking on the positive side, it is an excellent choice for a party game and should be played with more than one person. It could easily be a replacement for a board game on game night with your family. Basically, it was fun with friends while it lasted. Now, we look at the negative side. The biggest problem is the fact that you are made fully aware you are playing a video game, as opposed to an actual sport. For example, in tennis, you frequently miss balls that got past you because the computer didn't move you fast enough across the court. My sister and I found a what we call \"cheat spot\" in tennis where when you get served on the right side of the court, if you aim for the far left side the other player cannot reach the ball in time. What a flaw! Couldn't they just let you be able to override your character's movement with the D-pad? Furthermore, every game is based solely on timing and placement and not on any type of physics. It feels broken and unresponsive. The best sports being tennis, bowling, and baseball (in that order); and the worst being golf and boxing (in that order). The best of sports are that way because they at least feel slightly more real than the worst of sports. Also, playing for a while can make your hands sweat. Sweaty hands equal slippage of the Wii remote. That can obviously equal broken plasmas (trust me, just Google \"wii remote tv damage\"). This happens often in tennis and baseball. I was lucky I missed my flat screen and created a crater in the wall to the side of it, instead. It is not totally the game's fault, I am just warning you. Although, there was always the option of wearing the handcuff of the awkward wriststrap they give you.

This is always responsive, and something anyone can dip into. For that reason, bowling is in my opinion the best game in Wii Sports. Next is tennis. This should be amazing but instead, it's just shaking the wiimote at the right time. It doesn't matter how you swing or shake it- the way it aims is due to your timing. Still, this is a great game, though matches are too short, even at the highest settings. There's a baseball game, which responds accurately to how you hold and swing the wiimote. In the same way, when bowling, the controls are fast and responsive. Depending on how you swing, you can put a spin on the ball. Golf and boxing is where it all goes haywire. Golf works how you'd imagine, with the wiimote being the golf club. The controls respond well when hitting the ball long distance. But when you're close to the hole, on the fairway, the wii remote's sensing can't pick up gentle hits. So you're forced to hit the ball harder, and then it zips over the hole. Golf is more frustrating than it is fun. Boxing, meanwhile, responds accurately- just a second after you do something. This lag stops it from being enjoyable. As well as these sports, there are training minigames for each of them, which adds to the fun, plus improves your skill. There is also a fitness test which is useless as it tells you nothing about your fitness. The better you become at sports, the higher your 'level' becomes. At 1000, you become 'pro level'. And that's far from easy to do. Wii Sports is the first game to get for your wii simply because it showcases what that remote can do. But bad boxing and golf bring it down.… Expand",

Controls work pretty well, however, the spin controls work properly at a precentage of 49%. Sometimes when you release the ball by swinging and twisting at the same time with your remote as you release B, your ball will either go slow and go on the side or twist slowly no matter how you twist your remote. Golf was OK. The courses looked pretty nice, but the controls  When you swing your remote slowly as if you were putting, you can't hit the ball. You have to swing it a little more fast enough so the ball can land at a distance you want it to be at. And Boxing was a Hit. Controls work pretty well.

                "A fantastic racer and the best online Nintendo game ever. [Apr 2008, p.58]", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is the penultimate multiplayer experience on the Wii, and a must-own title for anyone serious about gaming.", 
                "It's a fast and fun racing game that is easy enough for beginners to pick up and enjoy while still a challenge for veteran players to master. The addition of online play (other than it's not so friendly friends system) and the introduction of the Wii’s motion technology add even more oil to what is already a pretty slick offering.", 
                "It's the ultimate Mario Kart package rather than the best, but it's still a lot of fun. [Apr 2008, p.47]",

                "The offline and online content is extremely entertaining and the pursuit of casual and hardcore karting has never been this much fun.", 
                "Still terribly fun with its competitive online modes and a great use of the Wii Wheel. And at the end of the day, it presents the traditional polished and shiny look of all of Nintendo’s big guns that we simply love. [May 2008]", 
                "Despite initial fears, this is proper Mario Kart, and it's Mario Kart done right. It's fast, it's fun and still one of the best party games ever created. Thanks to some seriously well-implemented online options though, it brings so much more to the table than its forebears, most notably in terms of longevity.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii against 11 real opponents is intense and exhilarating. Sometimes it's also infuriating but in the end that too is mostly a good thing. Still, something should have been done to the power ups of old. Fire and forget weapons and small chances of escape aren't the best combination. While the multiplayer side shines the single player parts are a let-down. Driving against cheating opponent and being constantly bombarded is frustrating. [May 2008]", 
                "The core Mario Kart gameplay remains basically unchanged, but it’s well executed and slightly enhanced by minor tweaks and a variety of control setups. The online mode is the real star here, however.", 
                "However, Mario Kart Wii is second on the series' podium as it rides alongside the N64 version’s tried-and-true track quality, offers the online play that the 64DD never brought around and sports superior graphics that make its 11-year-old counterpart look very dated on today's big-screen televisions.",

                "There are some things that feel completely out of whack though, such as the uncharacteristically cheap AI in 150cc, the lack of voice chat for an extremely social online game, reliance on friend codes, and \"everyone's a winner\" feeling you get when random items show up and completely turn the game upside down in an instant.", 
                "The package as a whole works well, not because of the packed in wheel, not because of the new content and innovation, but because Nintendo have proved that they understand what it is that makes this series great - the balance between racing and fighting.", 
                "The Wii Wheel and the wide open online courses all make it a lot less difficult for first time karters.",

                "Nintendo have managed to make the Wii-wheel work – something we were very sceptical about – and they’ve managed to bring Mario Kart online play to our TVs. Besides a few niggles with unfair A.I. and some average tracks, this is a valuable addition to the series.",

                "The weapons can get a little overwhelming and frustrating at times, especially when you’re in the lead (and the frankly unfair brutality of the 150cc-class rubber-banding, curse-evoking A.I.), but most of what’s in place, both old and new, still makes for a romping good time, locally or globally.", 
                "The bright, shiny visuals—now available in 480p—and the slide-whistle sound effects will make depressives choke on their Zoloft doses.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is a complete game. Of course, the addition of the online mode makes this title a keeper and a must have title for your Wii collection but for unconditional local multiplayer lovers, the offline mode has also received some upgrades and tweaks.", 
                "Then there is the Wii Wheel peripheral itself, which if you did not already know is just a plastic housing for the Wiimote. I have to admit though it is a well made bit of plastic, and is not only smarter looking than the uninspired Wii Zapper, but also more ergonomic to hold. Unexpectedly it is very easy to use.", 
                "Nintendo's draconian online service isn't a reason to dislike Mario Kart Wii in the same way that it's wrong to dislike a really beautiful woman because her husband is a complete tosser...As a Wii owner, we've got the definitive racing game on the console.", 
                "An excellent return to form for the series and tremendous fun when played with friends in split-screen or online. The often infuriating Grand Prix mode is likely to polarise gamers though, with some loving the unpredictability of it while others will simply give up after being taken down at the last minute by yet another Spiny Blue Shell.", 
                "Previous control schemes have always worked well with Mario Kart, and you can still use variations on these by adjusting your options, but the new wheel just feels so intuitive you’ll be wondering why they bothered including them.", 
                "We're treated to the same formula as we got the last time, with the major addition being the online mode. It’s not much, but since Mario Kart is all about playing together it's enough to make this an entertaining package.", 
                "One thing Mario Kart Wii features a lot of is multiplayer options.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is definitely up there with the other installments. A fairly limited single player appeal is enhanced by a comprehensive online service and a slightly toned-down but throughly enjoyable and flexible offline multiplayer mode.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii has many faults. But when it’s good, it’s very, very good, and as long as you have Wi-Fi, it will keep you occupied for many months to come.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is a great new game in the series. It still plays like a dream and is perhaps the most enjoyable game of the last few years. Even the additions of motorcycles, Wii-Wheel and online mode are suprisingly good. Mario Kart Wii even does something which most other games lack: It brings fun.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii doesn't stray far from the beaten track, but it has enough going to dazzle first-time MK drivers and a few new upgrades to challenge the long-time Karters, too.", 
                "Newcomers will find a fast-paced, easy-to-play title that relishes in its own ability to capitalize on the wacky approachability and fun of Nintendo’s mascot characters.", 
                "The overuse of power-ups is blatantly ridiculous and the general design hasn't changed much, but Kart is still a riotous romp.", 
                "A must-own Wii racer that pays multiplayer dividends.", 
                "Between the local and online multiplayer, as well as the plethora of single-player challenges available, this is the kind of game that has a ton of replay value. No, it’s not an overhaul, but it is an extremely solid entry in the series that lives up to the Mario Kart name.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii features an impressive online experience, but falls a bit short in the offline content.", 
                "Fast paced and colorful, Mario is a simple, enormously fun game that can suck up the hours as you continually say, \"just one more race.\"", 
                "This game gets a high recommendation for the multiplayer aspect but if you're in a position where you're going to be exploring single player consider this merely recommended.", 
                "After all the hype surrounding this game (or lack thereof), Mario Kart Wii is the same game we've been playing over and over again for years now, which either has you jumping up and down with glee or shaking your head in disgust.", 
                "It's the most complete Mario Kart package yet. [Issue#22, p.60]", 
                "In spite of a few valid criticisms, Mario Kart Wii is a ton of fun, albeit being the same experience as always wrapped in a different package.", 
                "At sixteen years young, Mario Kart has now made it to the Wii. Whilst fans of the series may lament some of the changes, it generally works well on the new platform. The focus has shifted away from a heavy skill requirement towards simply offering more entertainment.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is exactly what you would expect from this franchise, a solid offer that doesn't offer anything new, yet still manages to retain its appeal. Especially if you manage to get a few friends together to play it or decide to give use to its solid online capabilities.", 
                "Ultimately, the sheer sensory pleasure of playing Mario Kart Wii - from the charming animations, to the bopping tunes, to the sugar-rush boosting, to the exquisite steering - far overcomes the few concerns we have about it. It still has to be docked a mark for the awkward structure and compromised multiplayer modes - but it's still unreservedly recommended to anyone for whom Mario Kart is a gaming cornerstone.", 
                "While Mario Kart Wii is an enjoyable sequel we can't help but be a little disappointed that the same level of effort Nintendo put into Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros. isn't mirrored here.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii feels recycled and simplified from past installments, but it's saved by a handful of creative and nostalgaic courses and it's excellent 12-player online matches.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is fairly fun, although I do have to wonder how much play it will get in single-player mode. In multiplayer, you just have a blast with your friends.", 
                "In the end, Mario Kart Wii aims for a high level of fun and depending on how new you are to the franchise; it actually manages to do that.  There's plenty of room for improvement though.", 
                "At its core,  Mario Kart Wii is a simple, accessible title that lends itself to fun-filled evenings with friends on the couch or online games with racers halfway around the world.", 
                "With Mario Kart being the epitome of racing franchises for many years, it is sad to see how little the game changes its dry formula and actually takes several leisurely steps at addressing failing issues.", 
                "For anyone who has their Wii up and running online, you should definitely take the plunge, because the game's strengths will outweigh its flaws. If you can only play this game offline, however, then unless you're a masochist (or someone psychotic like me, who actually managed to get to the final stage of F-Zero GX’s crazy-hard Story Mode) pass on this; in fact, I'd go so far as to advise you to run in the other direction.", 
                "While Mario Kart Wii is predictably similar to its predecessors, something has changed with this installment. Something that makes it feel subtly unlike other Mario Karts--and not a change for the better. [June 2008, p.73]", 
                "Having sacrificed racing integrity in \"Double Dash\" to side with social silliness, Nintendo has turned 180 degrees into an awkward halfway house. [May 2008, p.86]", 
                "It might seem like the most complete Mario Kart experience yet, but in reaching for a wider audience, Nintendo may have lost sight of what made the series great in the first place. [May 2008, p.112]", 
                "[Mario Kart Wii's Battle Mode] is no longer a last-man-standing contest: Matches now last three minutes each, and if your kart takes too much damage, don't worry! You'll just respawn. Even worse, all battles are now played in teams of two. So while you can still have four human players, they can't all face off against each other -- and what's the point of that?",

HOWEVER, this enjoyment is hampered considerably due to the ever increasing amount of cheaters using hacked consoles to give themselves constant invincibility, infinite blue shells and other unfair advantages. For every 10 games played online, I would estimate you will encounter at LEAST 3 or 4 games with such cheaters. This was not a frequent occurrence when the game was initially released, but over time, and with Nintendo's proven unwillingness to address the issue, it has become a common annoyance which ruins the experience.\r Aside from the online play, the addition of motorbikes is the most visible addition to the series, and have become quite popular since, more often than not, they are faster than the karts the game is named for. Regardless, the choice between the two vehicle types adds nice variety and good challenge for the underdogs using the classic go karts.\r Lastly I should mention that while there are about 20 tracks, several of these are from previous games in the series making things seem not so original.

Single player is a great challenge, and people who complain about being taken out by items obviously haven't been paying attention - that's what Mario Kart is all about! Besides, if you're good enough you can avoid them (ie don't stay in the middle of the road, you know that's where Bullet Bill travels). Online is where the game really shows off: it's completely lag free and there's nearly always a maximum 11 opponents to race against. You will quite easily race 50 times in a row without realising how much time you've spent online in this game - it's just so damn addicting and fun.

This sucks, because it is annoying not to be able to just jump in wherever. But the bigger issue Mario Kart Wii is a good game, and is worth purchasing if you own a Wii. Its the latest iteration in the Mario Kart series, and it is a good game. But it isn't a great one, and its flaws rankle. First off, unlike its predecessors, you have to actually unlock the right to play every race. This sucks, because it is annoying not to be able to just jump in wherever. But the bigger issue here is that playing multiplayer -doesn't unlock the races-. So you get the game, plug it in to play with your friends (and you can now play with up to FOUR people vs the computers in the grand-prix type race) and... you can't play any but the first four cups without beating all the cups in single player. This is incredibly frustrating and there's absolutely no good reason for this. The races shouldn't be locked in the first place, and even if they had to be for some reason, there's absolutely no reason whatsoever multiplayer play shouldn't be able to unlock them. Battle Modes are, likewise, inferior; you can no longer do free-for-alls between four players, which were the most fun, and you can't do elimination battle matches anymore, which were also fun - why isn't this still an option, at least? There's no good reason for it. The computers also are very poor at battle mode. The items in this game also suffer from being too swingy. Blue shells are too difficult to avoid and Bullet Bills are just horribly overpowered and completely game-swinging, and frustrating when you're doing well and then suddenly a bullet bill comes up and beats you. Overall the game is a good game - its got good races (though I feel Mario Kart 64 had better courses on the whole) and it is a fun racing game, but there have been better racing games. If you play it alone, you'll probably like it quite a bit, but multiplayer just feels like second fiddle, and as I purchased it for the sole purpose of playing grand prix mode multiplayer, its quite annoying. That said, the time trials are quite cool in this game, as you race against \"ghosts\" which are previous racers. While this existed previously, you can now download and race against other players as well as the \"staff ghosts\", which makes it more enjoyable as you can sort of tell how well you're doing. Overall, thumbs up, but not the greatest game ever, let alone the greatest mario kart game ever. Incidentally, the Wii wheel is pretty awkward - you're better off using the controller.… Expand",

The removal of dual-player karts is also a step down from Double Dash, but the inclusion of tracks from SNES, GBA, N64, and GameCube are a welcome addition. Getting a 3-star overall rating is essentially impossible, so it's honestly baffling why they included it. Even two stars on 150cc tracks requires constantly restarting the 4-race circuit, and a constant stream of blue shells along with the unforgiving and cheap AI will result in controllers broken in frustration.

(Although after playing for a while you start to realize that it should be called Mario Bike, because there isn't much point to using the karts after realizing how much better the bikes are.)\r-Some of the new levels are really fun to play.\r Now for the negatives\r-Grand Prix is a huge let down.  After realizing that the wheel contoller syley is a hinderance instead of a help, and switching to the controller/numchuck configuration, 50cc is way too easy.  The rubber band AI in 150cc is so over the top that it's not really worth playing 150cc cups unless you want to unlock characters/carts/bikes/mirror mode.  100cc came close to being fun, but didn't quite balance out right.\r-The reliance of over-powered items (espically in 150cc) rather than making the AI better racers.\r-The wheel controller style is very inaccurate and annoying to use.\r-Battle mode isn't worth playing\r-No 2 player Grand Prix\r-This is way too much of a luck game.  I could understand having multiplayer purely casual (or as I would like to have seen, a way to change the setting between casual and hardcore style gaming) but making the solo player grand prix mode the way it is makes no sense to me.  The overpowered items, the terrible rubber band AI, the addition of 4 more racers to throw things at you, the fact that 9 times out of 10 all 12 racers finish the race within 3-5 seconds of each other so when you get hit with 3 red shells, 2 blue shells, and a pow block right at the end, you go from 1st to 11th, and just the simple fact that you can't go a tenth of a lap without getting hit with something make it very unenjoyable to play.\r-Overall the game felt lazy too me.  It seems as though they relied on the gimick of the wheel controller and the new items to sell the game, and in the process got very sloppy with the actual gameplay.\r So overall, I feel that this game had tons of potential, but unfortunatly a lot of it was wasted.

But, beneath the vibrant environments that Mario Kart has to offer, the experience as a whole is both short and shallow. Each track loses its spark after a race or two and there is just no reason to keep playing the campaign unless you are a completionist who needs to have every trophy in his possession. There is no clear advantage or disadvantage to any one racer, feeling like a wasted opportunity. In addition, no customization or skill points for one's Miis is a considerable letdown. But Mario Kart's worst offense is its perpetual frustration in regards to enemy AI. This game is one of those few titles that a player can deem \"cruelly unfair.\" Once you go deeper into the game, the competitions no longer depend on skill or driving ability but how lucky you are in regards to the number of blue shells blowing up in your face. The last race I played before discarding Mario Kart for a long time had me in first place mere feet from the finish line. A string of three shells fired at me in rapid succession dropped me from a first place victory to a 10th place embarrassment, and serves as a lasting reminder of my experience with the game.

The most annoying thing about Mario Kart Wii, by far, are the babyish/childish voices. Good lord, they are annoying. Not only are they excessive, high-pitched, and embarrassing, they are not natural in the least bit. Just about the only characters who have remained true to what they're supposed to sound like are Mario, Luigi, and Koopa Troopa, with Peach and Bowser being \"acceptable\". All the other characters, including Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Toad, etc sound odd and very childish. Why couldn't Nintendo included an option to turn off voice SFX and/or music like the previous Mario Karts? As for control, it can be somewhat difficult at times, as others have stated, but I believe with enough time spent in front of the TV, you'll eventually figure it out. The graphics are not as bad as many make it out to be - this is, after all, Nintendo. The items are fairly fun to use but can become very excessive - which leads me to my next point... The A.I., as others have stated before me, can be very unfair in the sense that you will be punished whether you are winning or not. This can happen via a blue shell as you're approaching the finish line in lap 3, or the fact that if ou lag behind far enough, pretty much no power-up (or series of power-ups) will save you.

For instance, getting hit by red shells non-stop, and those damn flying shells that hit you when you're in first place. Also, the favouritsm with the items is appaulling, if you're doing well (ie. the top three..) then you get horrible items like bananas and green shells. When you're in last, you get awesome items. It just isn't fair. -The Music: I remember when each Mario Kart level used to have distinct music that I would love to hear when I was playing the game. (Rainbow Road, anyone?) But it all seems a bit lost in translation here. Instead, we get o hear characters make annoying noises, such as \"WHOO HOO!\" and \"Yeahhhhhh!\" It's just plain irritating, and makes gameplay all the more difficult. And last, but not least, my last complaint is that the game seems to rely too much on a gimmick (the steering with the Wiimote) and, in turn the levels are just not that fun. Some levels are loaded with things that can hit you, you can fall off of, while others are just so boring you'll want to fall asleep while playing them.

                "Arguably this is the best Wii party game ever. It's also a great Motion Plus demonstration. [Sept 2009, p.72]", 
                "As far as mini-game collections go on the Wii, this is undoubtedly the cream of the crop. You'll be surprised how much fun you have with some events, and how little you garner from others, but there are still some rock solid experiences that you'll come back to again and again when friends and family gather.",

                "Wii Sports Resort  is proof of the full maturity of the Wii’s control system. Thanks to the Wii Motion Plus you can really do something unbeliveable in the past. Wii Sports Resort is a great title, which captures immediately casual and harddcore gamer. Unlike its predecessor, offers an high-level single player and you can play it for days. We don’t emphasize how much fun can give playing it in two or more people: it’s an experience that can make you laugh for hours and hours. Resort is undoubtedly Nintendo’s second great evolution.", 
                "Wii Sport Resort overtakes its predecessor in quality and quantity, resulting in a complete game experience.", 
                "For fans of Wii Sports, there’s no reason not to pick up Wii Sports Resort. It comes bundled with the Wii MotionPlus, contains several addictive offerings, and should provide some variety at your parents next Wii Sports party.",

                "Buying three extra peripherals and playing with others WILL make you happier... you won't want to take the trip alone. [Sept 2009, p.56]", 
                "The latest Wii Sports makes the original seem lacking in every department. With plenty of new gameplay modes, the inclusion of WMP and a bunch of new additions, 'Resort' is set to be one of the most important videogames of this summer. It's a shame that there's no online features, but still it has everything of what it takes to become a blockbuster in no time.", 
                "Ultimately, Wii Sports Resort is the concept of the first entry, but taken much further, in part thanks to the Wii Motion Plus, but also for Nintendo's will to make Wii Sports a more complete game, able to satisfy both veterans and newcomers.", 
                "More accessible and way more interesting than its predecessor, Wii Sports Resort isn’t only the best compilation of mini-games to be offered on the Wii console in a while but also a great way to display what the Wii Motion Plus accessory can do. However, keep in mind that the real fun of Wii Sports Resort will come out when you play in groups. If you like playing solo, this might not be the best game for you.", 
                "Given the price of admission, which includes the game and one MotionPlus controller, I’d say that you can’t go wrong picking up this title as it should keep you and your friends busy for quite some time.", 
                "Not all of the sports are winners and having a house full of people is still the best way to get the most enjoyment out of the game, but even with these slight caveats, it's hard not to recommend Wii Sports Resort to gamers of all ages and experience levels.", 
                "While not every event in the game is going to please you, I'm sure you'll find plenty of things to like, especially with a group of friends.", 
                "Wii Sports was a must for Wii owners, as anyone could pick up and play those games. Wii Sports Resort is also very fun to play with people, and it's an added experience with new games, more precise controls, and good ol' Wii Bowling and Golf.", 
                "But even without that crucial feature, Wii Sports Resort still feels like an accomplishment, not only because it offers a fun and accessible experience built around the MotionPlus attachment, but because it may very well renew optimism in those jaded by the lackluster motion controls seen over the last couple years.", 
                "With more than double the games and a new level of accuracy, Wii Sports Resort was worth the wait.", 
                "If Wii Sports was the Pong of our day, Wii Sports Resort is the Super Pong machine with color graphics and handball and hockey modes: Some of it is superfluous, but it’s worth the upgrade.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is more then a fun collection of sports, which are great to play together. Baseball, swordfight and table tennis are great games, but jet ski is less fun. Wii Motionplus is a great addition, and the game will last for hours if you play it together with friends. Are you a single player type of gamer? Then the game will get boring over time!", 
                "There's plenty here to do alone, but as with the original Wii Sports, Resort is far better when played with a friend.", 
                "I was lucky enough to review the game while my in-laws, who are not gamers, were visiting. We played every night, and they loved it. Nintendo is trying to reach the non-gamer audience, and Wii Sports Resort is just the prescription.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort manages to make us forget about controllers, displays and reality, and makes us play like kids, sensing that we really shot that arrow and we really took down those ten pins at bowling.", 
                "Yes, it may well be a tech demonstration of MotionPlus, but on the upside somebody built a game around it for us to have some fun with, and to experience how much WMP really does improve on the original controls.", 
                "Wii MotionPlus doesn't disappoint. The tiny, $20 peripheral (you get one free with the game; the rest are sold separately) is everything it's cracked up to be - when placed in the hands of developers who know what they're doing.", 
                "The addition of MotionPlus makes Wii Sports Resort more intuitive to play and adds lastability to gameplay. Controls aside, presentation and quantity of content has also been improved. [Sept 2009, p.108]", 
                "A glimpse into the promising future of what developers can do with the power of the MotionPlus. If you can, for just a moment, get past the fact that the console's motion controls were not 1:1 to begin with and not let that sour the experience, you will get a lot out of it.", 
                "This is hands down the best party experience on any home console, one that you will want to pick up as soon as you get a chance.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort serves as more than just a tech demo for WiiMotionPlus, and more than just a collection of minigames. It does well as a proper sequel to Wii Sports, being easy to pick up and fun to play alone or with friends. There is far more below the surface than meets the eye in this title that is far more hit than miss.", 
                "Resort demonstrates the MotionPlus upgrade perfectly and thus offers a decent multiplayer experience.", 
                "Although Wii Sports Resort looks simple, it uses the new Wii MotionPlus technology surprisingly well. Apart from the technological improvements the game contains twelve extensive sports that provides lots of entertainment when playing with company.", 
                "If you’re like me, where Wii Sports continues to get the most play on your Wii, then you’re surely itching to get your hands on Wii Sports Resort, if you haven’t done so already.", 
                "By buying Wii Sports Resort you get a game we recommend. The inferior graphics will be compensated by the beautiful sound and great gameplay. The only thing that should be stopping you from purchasing this game is the rare possibility that you have no-friends to play it with at all!", 
                "A great display of how motion-controlled gaming can work. Bigger and better than Wii Sports too.", 
                "A wide variety of games and accessible-yet-deep controls make Wii Sports Resort a must-have party game.", 
                "At the very least it’s a wonderful demonstration of the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus peripheral, and shows just how much it changes Wii motion sensing for the better. The device is incredibly accurate and Wii Sports Resort shows this extremely well in several games that are really fun – if just slightly shallow – sports-based diversions.", 
                "All in all, families that loved the first one would be well advised to pick up the sequel. It’s a better game, and for the price of admission you get an accessory that will (hopefully) allow for improved gameplay for the future.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort perhaps doesn't go as far as a good sequel should, but it's still - yes, yes - damned good fun.", 
                "A fun but shallow mini-game collection, whose hobbled simulations still make good use of the MotionPlus.", 
                "I strongly suspect people will pick up Wii Sports Resort on name recognition alone, and be mystified by the odd white attachment inside. If enough WMPs are sold, and enough developers pay attention, it may just work.", 
                "The Wii Sports along this becomes almost a demo. The number of modes and games available is great. It is spectacular to put the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus in test and improve the control of movements of the Wii, given that we have a fun game here.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is a fantastic showpiece for MotionPlus, and the one thing that Gamestyle takes away from its time with the game is the possibility of what it could lead to.", 
                "Set of minigames takes full advantage of the enhanced abilities you get with the new Motion Plus controller. Graphics are still a bit lame but a wide range of sports and accessibility will satisfy every kind of casual gamer. [Sept 2009]", 
                "Motion Plus tech demo lacks the depth of the real game. Non-gamers loves this though, and you can have a lot of fun with it, if your friends are stupid, drunk or both. [July 2009]", 
                "With two or more players, the sequel is, once again, a compulsive riot. Played alone, however, some of its pieces seem sweet, but a little empty.", 
                "Most of the mini-games are surprisingly skill-based, and even Wii Sports haters should find something to enjoy. I definitely did.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort fits into the rotation of party games, but it has the breezy weakness of being lost in the shuffle.", 
                "For Wii Sports diehards, Wii Sports Resort will be worth a look, but for the rest of us – especially those who’ve thrashed Bowling to death already, this is a patchy offering more notable for its missed opportunities than its successes.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is a mixed bag when it comes to value for money. If you already own a number of Wiimotes this will give you a really entertaining experience with friends and family. Most of the new minigames are really entertaining and the revamped ones have been greatly improved. The Wii Motion Plus does improve the overall feeling a lot, but since it remedies past shortcomings that's more of a necessity than a strength. As a whole this is definitely not entertaining enough to warrant multiple purchases to get the Wii Motion Plus but if you already own the controls you'll find a lot to like here.", 
                "Sports Resort is controlling, and even solemn, about just how much fun you should be having with it. And that’s a development that should chill every Wii owner to the bone."

Wii Sports Resort didn't need a setting, so this is a nice touch.\rSome of the best minigames take place on the water- wakeboarding, which uses the motion sensing of the wii remote, is maybe my favourite. Another favourite is power cruising, which has you race through arches as fast as possible.\rThere's also cycling, which is especially fun in multiplayer. Another great minigame lets you freely explore the island resort... on a plane. In this minigame, you can fly over places, dive down a crater, and do so much more.\rArchery is another excellent game, one of the best. Of the twelve sports, though, there are a  few stinkers. Golf in the original wii sports was bad because half the time, it couldn't sense the motion properly. It returns in sport resort, and you'd think motionplus would improve it, but no. The sensing is just as bad.\rAnother stinker is bowling, again copied from wii sports. But unlike wii sports, the ball moves erratically however you flick the remote. Weird that it's actually worse with motionplus.\rBut overall, sports resort is a great minigame collection, and uses the wii remote in a variety of different ways. There's no online, which is a shame, but multiplayer is a complete blast. It's one of the most addictive experiences on the wii. Sadly, single player is greatly lacking, so if you for whatever reason can only play on your own, I suggest you give this a miss. But with friends, it's the ultimate party game.… Expand",

It's simple, it's fun, and it's everything I'd want from a sport included in this package. Score: 10/10\r Wakeboarding may get old fast for some but it definitely didn't for me! I love going on the sea and doing all sorts of cool tricks to earn points. It always read my motions perfectly so I never felt cheated out of not doing a certain trick right. Score: 9/10\r Frisbee is a bit tough but it's really fun once you get the hang of it. You have to throw a frisbee into a certain area so a dog can catch it. The more on target you are with the area, the more points you'll earn. There's also a Golf Frisbee mode in which the dog isn't there and you're throwing a frisbee on a golf course but I prefer dog frisbee. Score: 9/10\r Archery: This definitely isn't my cup of tea but I can see how it would appeal to some. My hands shake a lot so it's hard for me to get the arrow correctly on the target. There's tons of variety in this mode though. You can shoot fruit from a distance so it's pretty good if you're looking for replay value. It's just not my personal favorite. Score: 8/10\r Basketball: This one's pretty fun if you're playing it with another actual person. Playing with the CPU can get pretty tough at times but if you want to get a higher skill level, that's your chance. Basketball can be very simple once you get the hang of it and it's one of my favorites. Score: 9/10\r Table Tennis: I don't know how much fun I had with this one but I know it was a lot! Table Tennis, or Ping Pong, has a lot of modes. You can play against a friend or against a CPU or you can see how many times you can hit the Ping Pong ball back and forth before you stop! This mode is so addictive I can't even express it in words! Score: 10/10\r Golf: It's about as good as it was in the original Wii Sports, which wasn't that good. I don't really enjoy it that much. It's slow-paced and kind of boring. Score: 6/10\r Bowling: It's about as good as it was in the original Wii Sports, which was excellent. Wii Sports Resort has revealed with its MotionPlus technology that my bowling ball throwing isn't as good as I thought it was. Still, bowling is super enjoyable and I love it! The 100-pin bowling is a nice twist that's also pretty fun. Score: 10/10\r Power Cruising: Um...no comment. Score: 3/10 (I'm sorry, I'm just terrible and can never get the controls for this game).\r Canoeing: This one's decent. I guess as you can tell, I'm not the biggest fan of water sports. This one can be pretty challenging especially when playing it with 2 players. I'm pretty sure the MotionPlus isn't reading my movements correctly on this one, but who am I to say if it is or not? Score: 4/10\r Cycling: Finally, another great sport! Cycling is a combination of getting a workout and making your brain work. You have to think about how fast to go and when to stop because if you go too fast, then your Mii will start tiring out. It can be pretty tough to get to 1st place as you usually start at about 30th place or 41st place, but it's all worth it when you do!

They definitely need to make a Pilotwings Wii U now or at least an island flyover separate game. It's my favorite in the collection. Skydiving is also amazing. You have to link up with other skydivers to get more points. Dogfighting's the only sport that has to be done with two players but it's also enjoyable.

                "The new moves, power-ups and graphics are just enough to make this game feel original while keeping its roots in the past. Even though New Super Mario Bros. isn't a revolution, it's still a great fun platforming game.", 
                "It’s worth getting a DS, that’s for sure. But if you’re one of those junkies that doesn’t pay full price for a game because it hardly makes use of the system’s “capabilities”, then fine; be that junky.",

                "New Super Mario Bros. is a solid platformer and a nice homage to the Mario series, but it's not Mario's big return to 2D gameplay like everyone thought it would be.", 
                "The versus mode breathes some fresh air into his little lungs, but this latest foray has us wondering: can Mario ever truly be new again?", 
                "With summer here there is going to be more gaming on the go as handhelds get taken on road trips. And just in time, Nintendo has given us a blast from the past to take along and relive the fun of our wasted youths. The game mechanics show a bit of their age, but it is still a lot of great, simple fun.", 
                "Nintendo's crafted a thoroughly enjoyable game here, a solid portable experience packed with everything that makes Mario so great -- challenge, fanservice, secrets. Everything except brash imagination.", 
                "Far too many of the NSMB levels are simply too short. Even in the final world, it feels as though you're hitting the midway restart point in seconds, and then crossing the finish line when the level was just hitting its stride.", 
                "Is it as good as \"Yoshi’s Island,\" \"Super Mario World,\" or \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"? No. And that is a disappointing fact. It is, however, a solid game, worth it for the nostalgic trip alone.", 
                "This game should prove fairly easy to those of us who have grown up with previous Mario titles; the levels are incredibly short, the difficulty is fair at best, and the whole thing seems to need a bit more fleshing out.", 
                "In a family whose every member shouts from the rooftops, it risks palling into the background. Set it on its own, though – or besides absolutely any other 2D platformer – and it shines with dazzling kaleidoscopic brightness. [July 2006, p.78]", 
                "New Super Mario Bros. definitely doesn’t live up to the standards set by the games it apes, but there’s still no better sidescroller to be found on the DS.", 
                "It is a fantastic package, no doubt. Despite the single-player’s unfortunate lack of length, and the ease with which many will speed through it, New Super Mario Bros. is everything one could want from a return to 2D Mario. [July 2006, p.118]", 
                "The wall jump from Mario 64 is perhaps the single best introduction to NEW Super Mario Bros.", 
                "Welcome back, Mario. Each day without you was like another dagger through my (S)NES, and your return is triumphant if short-lived.", 
                "New Super Mario Bros might not be QUITE as good as some review sites might lead you to believe, but there is no denying that this is a damn fine game: the game play is there, that familiar Nintendo charm is dominant throughout the entire game, the sounds are good, and it's definitely got personality. The good far outweighs the bad.", 
                "The level of nostalgia is really unsurpassed. However, the quest ends a little too quickly and the lack of flight is a tremendous downer.", 
                "I can talk about why the game is fun, but I can't lie and say the game is brilliant. Mario isn't what he used to be. There are glimmers and flickers of greatness in this game -  moments where I felt the magic might almost be back. But it's not. Not yet.", 
                "It is almost as if half way into production one of the higher ups saw the progress, wasn’t happy and forced them to stick to the old formula that’s more than a decade old. The game is also really short."

NSMB features 8 different worlds, each with a distinct theme. Nowadays everyone is sick of seeing the same 8 world-themes in 2D Mario games, but this is the game that introduced them, and I think it was a good idea. As for the levels, most of them are really fun and well designed. Each levels holds 3 optional Star Coins, which are the main collectables in this game. Most of them are pretty easy to get though. The whole game is a bit on the easy side, actually. This might bother some of the old-school Mario fans, and it might be the game's biggest flaw. The amount and variety of levels is satisfactory to me. The game is bit short, but I think the overall quality and replay value make up for that\r NSMB introuduced some really cool power-ups. The giant mushroom, the mini mushroom and the blue koopa shell are among my favorite Mario power-ups of all time. They're very fun to use. As for the bosses, all of them are OK, but once again, they are way too easy. The game has also a bunch of multiplayer modes, but I didn't play them very much, so I won't comment about them.\r Visually, the game is colorful and has a good level of polish. It mixes 2D backgrounds with 3D models, and the result looks just fine. The melodies are as catchy and happy as ever. Overall, this is a very lighthearted and happy game, one that will put a smile on your face for the time you are playing.\r Some people criticize this game for being too simplistic and not really innovate in any area, like Super Mario World did in 1990. But the truth is that NSMB is pure 2D Mario greatness, it's a return to the more traditional style of the NES Mario titles, which is just perfect as it is. So whether you are a fan of the series, or platformers in general, you need to give this game a try. I would even say it is the best of the new generation 2D Mario games, despite being the worst technology-wise.\r Score: 9.0… Expand",

I really like sonic games, but there's a huge difference between these two games. Sonic Rush simply gives us about twenty levels of more of the same. Rush is short and has nothing new to it. New super mario bros on the other hand successfully takes us back to the oldschool mario days while simultaniously adding tons of new , obsticles, power ups, and moves to the 2-D mario mix. The game consists of about 80 courses (much more levels than sonic rush) These additions work extrememly well with the oldschool mario world. Mario gets a few moves from super mario 64. You can wall jump, butt stomp, and do triple jumps. These new moves make mario as agile as he's ever been in a 2-D game. Then there's the new power ups. There's the Giant Mushroom power up (which is rare and hard to get) which allows you to grow to ten times your original size and for a short time obliterate the level. The shell power up puts a turtle shell on mario's back, and after a quick run you're bouncing around like a stray turtle shell. This power up is a bit unwieldly but once mastered it can be even more powerful than the classic fireball power up. The mini-shroom power up shrinks mario down to miniscule size allowing you to access different game areas, as well as allowing you to jump higher and walk on water. The bad thing about the mini-shroom is you die in one hit, and you must butt-stomp opponents in order to do damage. Some of the new obsticles are mushrooms that tilt sideways as you walk on them, platforms that toss you up into the air like a helecopter, pipes that shoot you out like a cannon, and puzzlles that require you to wall jump or have one of the new power ups in the game. There's more than one path in the game. You can unlock alternate paths by using star cions (simular to the yoshi coins from Super Mario World).

New powerups include the mega mushroom, the mini mushroom and shell suit which can be interestingly used to get to hidden areas to find hidden exits or help you clear a level easier. The bosses are great to fight but a tad too easy with some obvious attack patterns. There's a sense of nostalgia when playing this game because this plays similar to the original Super Mario Bros. and has some of the memorable enemies like the Koopa Troopa's and Goomba's which have been given a graphical make over thanks to the Nintendo's DS's more powerful hardware. Even the simple story is similar to Super Mario Bros. but now Bowser Jr has captured Princess Peach and taken her to his castle. The graphics are very nice and the backgrounds are nicely rendered and despite the game play being a bit too simple, there's a great deal of fun to be had and 8 worlds with different themes to complete. The music is brilliant and some of the composed music are remixes of previous Mario game themes such as the Underground theme in Super Mario Bros. What's annoying is that if you want to find a hidden exit in a level and you need a powerup like the shell suit to break blocks which are in your way or a mini mushroom to squeeze through a pipe, you need to get the power up from either normal game play or one from a toad house. Depending on what power up is added to your reserve inventory, depends if you can headbutt the block that contains a random generating item at the right time (basically its like a slot machine and you have to hit the block to stop it on a random item which then is added to your reserve inventory for use later). Hitting this block at the right time is a bummer so you get the item you need and can lead to you leaving the toads house, coming back in and trying again.

The Game consists of a large variety of levels with some that pay tribute to the games of the past as well as others that capitalize on new unique concepts within the game. The music is fun and rather enjoyable to listen to while the sound effects for the most part consist of the same set of pre-recorded stock sound effects used in other Mario releases but fit in perfectly fine. The difficulty curve within the game is balanced so that it can satisfy the needs of both beginners and experts well at the same time. Bonus content within the game consists of an alternate playable character and special game modes can be accessed by inputing a code, in-game wallpapers and infinite-use Toad houses to access power ups that need to be unlocked, A multiplayer Mario vs Luigi mode and a Mini-game mode for both single player and multiplayer through wireless that can be access from the main menu at any time.

The game definitely looks and sounds great, but casual gamers and platform genre newcomers might struggle a bit in certain levels. It does not take too much time to beat the game, but getting all gold and unlocking all the stuff can easily double the time if you are not hardcore Mario gamer. There are also some mini-games and multiplayer support, but the former are passable at best while I was not able to test the latter.

The manic bubble game and shooting range are brilliant for quick on the draw types and make you realize how wonderful the Wiimote is.

                "Hey people, this game is a couple of quid as it comes with a wii remote. I wasn't expecting a Zelda but its definitely playful and worth getting if you buying a remote.",

                "It's good to get used to the controller and some of the games are fun head to head. I would have given it a higher rating if it allowed some of it's games to go to 4 players (something sorely missing in Wii games so far).",

                "Simple games (old style circa 10-15 years ago) but made different with the wii controler, they dont require much thought and will be short lived but cinda nice to play in a no brainer way and you get a controller, should have been bundeled with the consul.",

                "This game is not groundbreaking but it is highly addictive and fun. It's a good quick fix game that my wife and I play often. If you are going to spend $40 for an extra remote, spend the extra $10 for Wii Play.",

So yeah, its hard to say its a bad game when its not really a proper game, but at the same time you can't say its great either... I think a nice round 7 nicely represents it. Definitely get it though when/if you buy a new wiimote, its worth the extra fiver at any rate.… Expand", 
                "The reason I take off points is because this isn't really a game. It is more like training for use of the wii-mote and it serves its purpose well. At first I was very shaky with the pointer but after a few round of Wii play shooting everything feels smooth. A must buy for Wii owners seeing as it comes as little more than a few dollars with the wiimote.",

Except half the games were downright dumb, the fishing give me a break.they could have made the fishing more realistic.and the whole pose your mii thing was stupid....id say its worth getting just for the three fun minigames. Billiards,table tennis, and laser hockey.",

                "If you whizz through all the games, it's barely worth the premium over just getting a second remote. But with a little perseverance and open-mindedness, all apart from Pose Mii are surprisingly compelling. Find Mii looks the most childish but turns out to be tough and addictive, the best of the lot.", 
                "It's an improvement on Wii Sports, but that's not saying much. I only bought it for the extra Wii remote it comes with, otherwise this game was a complete waste of money.", 
                "Now here is an excellent 2 player game.Lets be honest,you can play solo and have fun for a limited amount of time but the 2 player is the reason to own this game.My wife and I have tons of fun to this day with this game and Wii sports resort.", 
                "I actually really like this game! I find that I always reach for it. Maybe its the simplicity yet challenging aspect of all the games... I don't know. But some of these games are actually really addicting. The only game that I don't like is that Tank game... I still don't really know how to play that... but other than that all the other 8 games are amazing :)", 
                "The thing about this game is that there is a lack of content. The minigames get boring quickly and thats the only thing going for it. It is only worth playing if you are a hardcore Wii/Mii series fan.", 
                "Honestly, this game is basically just like wii sports with the same flaws but worse. There is less wrist action and more boring mini games. The games are even shorter than the ones on wii sports and they don't progressively get harder either. Th multiplayer is now limited to two people which is even worse. I only bought this game for the extra wii remote. That's about it.", 
                "Its a fun game and playing it with a friend to compete for supremacy adds in a replay factor. Other than that this mini game collection left potential on the table for improvement.", 
                "Nowhere near the level of Wii Sports. The multiplayer was fun for about 5 minutes, then we put the game on a shelf and never picked it up again. Not worth a buy even as a Wiimote bundle (which is how I got it).", 
                "Quite fun. Lots of fun little mini games that can provide a couple of hours fun. It's pretty cheap, too, being bundled together with a Nintendo Wii Remote. The game is a fun game to teach your family some of the basics of the Nintendo Wii controller and its motion capabilities. Good games to calm you down after a long day of boredom.", 
                "The games in this are reasonably fun, though I wish there were more. I got this with Wii Music for £10.99 ($17.89) so for the price I think it's worth it. Having medals to earn makes it a bit more enjoyable.",

The main reason being that's it a tiny bit short in playtime, and the second being that while Wiimote-controls work great, you can't help but wonder if it wouldn't have worked just as good with a normal control. But considering how much gaming joy the game offers, there's no point in getting stuck on those details. This will probably be a given game on any Nintendo Wii-owners wishlist this Christmas.",

But as a traditional 2D platform game it's the business.",

It's classic mario with a bunch of enhancements and power-ups that were thought up with originally and utmost care. I was so happy to hear that it could be 2-4 player co-op and I was happy to hear that the game was very challenging. Maybe sometimes too challenging, but when 4 people play, it works much better. Graphics are good enough for me. The story is a bit silly, but I expected nothing less of a Mario game. The only thing that really bothers me is the game's hefty price. Here in Canada, it's 65 bucks. That's too much for a nintendo wii game. Let alone, a game that's simply a unique turn of a classic mario game. If you are good at side-scrolling platforms, you can run through new super mario bros wii in 6 hours (without cannon skips). It'll probably take you 15-25 hours to get 100% and there are a few mini-games to entertain you, but that's about it. Too bad there was no online co-op option available. Maybe next time. But I can't help give this game a 9 out of 10 for being a new success for Nintendo Wii and because the Nintendo company never lets us down when it comes to their own games. Twilight Princess, Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, SSB Brawl and New super mario bros wii are amazing games. You just have to sit through all the crap games to get to them.… Expand",

Also the inclusion of Yoshi instantly brought a smile to my face being able to swallow koopas and then spit out the shells was awesome. And I've heard people saying that this game was hard, but I completely disagree. I had hours of fun with this game and I felt so good when I got that kiss on the cheek from peach after I rescued her (Even though I just rescued her from a demon-turtle-dragon-thing).… Expand",

Even if you play this single player, it is a worthy entry in the Mario series.The bulk of the fun comes from multiplayer.  While it can be frustrating at times, especially with newer players, the fun factor increases as people become more comfortable with the game.  In a nutshell, it's a traditional 2D Mario game with multiplayer but you don't have to take turns.  It's a fantastic experience.So why not a 10?  The difficulty.  I don't mind difficult games.  I have fun with easy games as well.  The problem with this Mario game is the first 8 worlds are relatively on the easy side.  The difficulty goes up progressively as you move from world to world but it is still manageable.  The problem I have is when you successfully collect all of the star coins from Worlds 1-8.  After you accomplish this, a special World 9 opens.  The difficulty in World 9 almost gets to the point of not wanting to finish the game.  It can get extremely frustrating.  Again, I don't mind difficulty in games but I was completely unprepared for World 9.  If you want to finish the game (and I did), be prepared to be patient and be almost perfect to complete this World.Other than this one minor gripe, I recommend this game for everyone!… Expand",

The most recent edition to the Mario kart series isThe story behind it\rMario kart is a racing game that was first launched on the super Nintendo entertainment system in 1962 which was known as Mario kart 64 and is also available via Google play store as well, to date there has been four Mario karts games for home consoles (ds and wii), three for portable games and 2 Namco arcade games. The most recent edition to the Mario kart series is Mario kart 7 which was released onto 3DS sometime last year, there are two more games in the Mario kart series in development which ach are one for the new wii u system and another arcade edition which could hit the shops any time now. The Mario kart games have developed so much over time and the producer has bought in many new things and changed the content every time this has included new items, new characters and many more as well as new tracks different elements, this was to keep the game play fresh and so people who bought all of them weren’t getting the same thing every time so if u has all of them you are never getting the same game on each edition because new content is always added. The one on the ds was probably one of the best racing games ive ever played. Each series contained at least 16 original courses and plus different versions of current tracks E.G. Rainbow road was included in the 16 but then rainbow road 2 was a sequel and not included in the 16 because this was one of the tracks that was released at a later date.\r Suitability\rThe game is suitable for all ages as there is absolutely no violence involved and everyone can play it as it’s a family game which everyone one can play, it is quite addictive because you never know what is going to happen as there is many different tracks which contain many different obstacles so this game isn’t something you can really practice as there is so much content and so many obstacles involved within it. It doesn’t affect your social impacts because it is actually good because you are getting exercise whether you are playing it on Wii or DS. Why it is a good game\rIt was a very good game as there is so much game play and technical ability involved within and is never boring because you never know what is going to happen. The game also tests how quick you are at reacting for example when the obstacles such as rocks are rolling down the track you have to react quickly in order to dodge them as if you get hit if you have any items these will be lost and also any coins that were collected along the track a 1/3 of them will be lost (Mario kart 7 only)I love the technical ability of this game and has got better and better every time a new one is released because this game is no ordinary racing game and is never boring because of all the different items and the different effects that the game unleashes in the middle of the laps, my personal favourite track is rainbow road because I love the colours as is a quick reaction track because the track has a very tight specific area you have to stick too and the layout of the track is consistent so this is also hard where as the others there is side bits that you can use instead of the normal section of the track to try and get more items and to try and get a head start on everyone else but rainbow road doesn’t and is just straight track from start to finish and also contains loops to try and distract you to try and make you fall off, the other reason is it’s a good game is because it enables you to race against other people all over the world using the built in wireless connection system which adds alot of excitement and pressure into the game which is another reason why this is probably why this is one of the best racing games around and will probably only get better when the new editions have finished development and are launched, I personally cannot wait.… Expand",

Thanks to Mario Kart DS, and also to Zelda Phantom Hourglass, I decided to buy a Nintendo DS in christmas 2010, and played it again to get the true experience.\r I think this is probably my favorite Mario Kart title. It has great controls, a good selection of characters and plenty of modes to keep you entertained for a pretty long time. The game has more characters than any Mario Kart before it, and it also introduces Retro Cups: 16 tracks from previous Mario Kart games, adding to a total of 32 tracks, more than any MK game before it. There's even a series of missions to complete, including a bunch of boss fights. What else can you ask from a Mario Kart game?\r The game is very fun to play alone. Another single-player mode that is worth mentioning is Battle Mode, which is surprisingly addictive and entertaining. Online modes are also present, and they're obviously a ton of fun. Playing Mario Kart DS with your friends is always a blast.\r So overall, this is pretty much everything you could expect from a Mario Kart game. Tons of fun, a good amount of content, great multiplayer options... definitely a must have for any DS owner.  I really don't know what to criticize here. Maybe the graphics look a little bit unpolished compared to other DS titles, but It's no big deal. It doesn't detract from the experience at all.\r Score: 9.0… Expand",

                "When judging Wii Fit overall, you're very conscious of the fact that it doesn't achieve anything for its users that couldn't be managed with a little willpower. Worse still, the most entertaining 'games' in the package are the ones that improve balance rather than promote weight loss or muscle tone, which potentially damage its 'good for you' fun credentials further. With that said, it's true that any exercise is better than nothing.",

As such, I've given it a 7 rather than a lower score so as to not unfairly lower it's tally. I was super excited about Wii Fit. I'm 33, and I used to have no trouble staying fit during my twenties, as there was always a basketball game, or a volleyball game, or the like to get in on with friends. Now that I've hit my thirties, though, and all my friends are married with children, I've gone about three years without any exercise at all. In that time, I've tacked on 30 pounds of gut, but as someone who hates exercising just for the sake of exercising (I get bored easily) Wii Fit looked like a godsend. Exercising made fun and interactive in the privacy of my own home, whenever I want to exercise? Sounds great, sign me up! In my mind, I hoped that the balance board would be as fun a gaming innovation as the wiimote has been in Wii Sports. Unfortunately, it hasn't turned out that way. None of the games in Wii Fit are that entertaining. The slalom and ski jumping, which I thought would be awesome, are really pretty lame. Okay, so it's still gonna be work and not so much fun, but it's convenient, right? Well, so far, not so much. I've spent about four hours on it, and only amassed an hour and a half of actual exercise time, by its calculations. Sure, the initial session takes extra time because of the initial set-up and the explanations for the exercises, but even my second session was incredibly inefficient. It took me an hour and a half to log on 30 minutes of exercise. And I only watched a couple of exercise demos. Now, as I spend more time at it it will increase the number of reps and duration of the exercises, which should help, but I haven't touched it in a week because I felt like it was doing such a great job of sucking away my time while giving me very little exercise and almost no entertainment value. There are only a few exercises that really feel like significant exercises so far: mainly the side-plank, the lunge, the hula hoop, and the free jogging. Even so, I was able to net a perfect score on the side-plank on each of my first two tries: and I am in terrible shape! Sure, they will add reps, but there just isn't much significant challenge. I actually really enjoy the jogging and the hula hoop, but its a shame that from the start you can't set them for longer durations to give yourself a more efficient work out. Instead, you have to do them in short bursts and constantly start and stop to try and get a decent work out while waiting for the game to open up longer versions. So, in conclusion, as I use Wii Fit more and more it will hopefully get more efficient as I unlock longer and harder versions of the exercises, but if you're looking for entertainment, or a good workout right out of the box, it's just not going to happen. Your going to have to put in the hours just to get the game to open up to the point that you can get a meaningful, decent, and somewhat time efficient exercise program out of it.… Expand",

The exercises are simple, fun, and the presence of your friend's Miis make it feel more familliar. It's easy to be fooled by the simplicity of these exercises - done properly, they can provide an excellent workout. The core training provides an outlet to explore your own center of balance, flexibility, and core awareness that is inventive, creative - and enjoyable. You can easily combine aerobic exercises to make a longer \"cardio\" workout if you desire, especially after you unlock longer distances (which doesn't take long). Four days after getting my Fit, my body is pleasantly achy.. and I wouldn't consider myself among the ranks of the \"unfit\". I managed to string together a well-rounded workout without too much fuss - for those saying it takes too long between exercises, try to continue to run in place while selecting your next exercise. The biggest shortcoming is the inability to streamline through a longer workout (eg. have it \"remember\" your 10 selections) and the lack of multi-player function without having to exit your Mii to the plaza. I'm sure these things will come in the next version, and in the meantime, aren't that much of a big deal with a little creativity. All in all, the Fit provides a great and interesting way to work out for both experienced exercisers and \"couch potatoes\" alike ('cmon \"buff\" people - as IF your abs didn't hurt after your first round of Super Hula Hoop). People complaining about the price amaze me - isn't a regular game around $50-60?

The gift of the wii board opened up everyone to another way of playing that was generally speaking even field as all of us naturally to some extent have a good sense of balance. With some practice at the mini game, we all started to improve and constantly teaching each other how to get higher points which really means how to better balance yourself........... I am a lot more aware of my balance than I ever was and just as a side note, my muscles are really getting one heck of a workout from yoga and muscle workouts and they do work ( much more than I expected them to work cause the reps just keep getting higher as you achieve each mark) This game will be used for a long time to come.… Expand",

Lastly, and most importantly to casual gamers, having to unlock everything is a huge pain. Who has the time to play the game so that everything becomes unlocked? It doesn't even unlock more games in the category you're playing either, just the longer you play the game the more some random game unlocks, and then you have to play basic before advanced which is a slap in the face to those of us who can do super basic aerobics no problem.… Expand",

At 5'8\" and 177 pounds, I'm \"overweight\" according to the BMI metric. Yet on the strength training games, I can easily get \"bodybuilder\" (like, without even picking up the game ever before). Hmm, I wonder why that is...? The game even goes so far as to say \"...BMI is a measure of body fat...\" which is not correct. It is merely a biometric measurement of proportionate weight. Someone could have rippling 8 pack abs and the lowest LDL cholesterol ever and still be obese according to this game, represented by a huge fat version of your Mii. Maybe if everyone did the kinds of exercises in this game - waving video game controllers around and standing - instead of doing actual exercise like weight training and long distance activities, then BMI might be a reasonable measurement of fat, because only people who would be extremely skinny would not be flabby. As it is, the game told me to go down to 145 pounds. I am a grown white man who can run half marathons daily and bench press over 250 pounds - at 145 pounds I would have the physique of a 13 year old, basically. 2.) The exercises are inadequate. Overhead tricep extensions with a Wiimote? Give me a break, maybe if you had me hold about 80 of them it would start to be a workout. The exercise intensity ranges from \"wave your arms around\" to \"do a poor man's version of Dance Dance Revolution\", none of which are appropriately intense for anyone trying to achieve fitness goals. Maybe if they supplied a 250 kg Olympic weight set with the game, it would start to be difficult or rewarding. 3.) Essentially the only lifestyle advice it gives is stuff 5 years olds hear. \"Brush your teeth\" \"go to sleep\" \"don't sit down too long\" \"stand up straight\", as if this is supposed to afford you some kind fitness model physique. There is no appropriate advice for diet, which is probably a good thing since it would no doubt be something like \"eat lots of fruits and vegetables, don't drink too much soda pop, and purchase Nintendo (TM) power bars\". The \"exercises\" performed in this game are utter gash and will not help you achieve any fitness goals unless you can hardly stand to begin with. 4.) Since it's utterly devoid of any purpose in improving anyone's health, the only remaining measure is how good it is as a video game. Let me put it this way. How does running in place for 30 minutes, doing isometric calisthenics for 30 seconds (such as planks), or enduring crappy infrared controller detection and losing games because of it sound to you? If none of that sounds interesting, I would advise you to avoid this purchase, because you're not going to get anything else out of it.… Expand",

                "It's the best and the biggest sandbox ever made. The story and how it's told, the deep world around us where there's always something happening, and the amount of content and things to do, make it the perfect closure for this generation.", 
                "Part of what makes the game so generally appealing is that, for the most part, it drops the nagging feeling of “good for an open world game.\"...Grand Theft Auto V is a good shooter and a good driving game with responsive character control. While some of the extras might be spread a little thin, there are no compromises with these central mechanics, which is a feat for a game of this breadth.", 
                "If a picture is worth a thousand words then the game itself is a novel every city block and every dusty trail. It’s the million dollar fireworks display at the end of the current generation cycle of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 – handing out free beer and barbeque chicken wings.", 
                "If anyone is still wondering if GTA has lost its ability to take on the politically correct about ‘appropriate’ content, do not fear, as it is full of violence, social commentary and explicit nature that is sure to aggravate someone with too much time on their hands.", 
                "There’s simply more here than in any game before, and yet quality is never sacrificed for quantity. Personal favourites will persist, but it’s hard to put anything else on top of the pile. Everything you’ve ever wanted a GTA game to be, and a whole lot more. Consistently hilarious, constantly compelling and combining never-before-seen scale and ambition. This is going to make next-gen look bad for a long time to come.", 
                "No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.", 
                "Rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. GTA V is not perfect but has everything you'll ever dream in a sandbox game. San Andreas is gorgeous and full of life, Trevor, Michael and Franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects you won't believe that it runs on an eight years old hardware. It's worth your money, it's worth you time.", 
                "With a swan song to the aging console generation Rockstar once again shows us what Open World really means. The Developer takes a sandbox, blows it up to the size of a football field, fills it with the most beautiful sand and all the toys we really want to play with.", 
                "GTA IV was extraordinarily good, but it took itself a little bit too seriously. GTA V outdoes even San Andreas when it comes to changing up standard shootouts with more wacky, explosive and memorable missions. [October 2013 p.56]", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is the magnum opus of the current generation. It has an amazing game world filled with loads of content and the feeling that you can do literally anything you want. Add three fantastic main characters to it, with their flaws and virtues and you have the recipe for this magnificent game. Nothing less than a masterpiece.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of perfection. It has a bit of everything for everyone in terms of gameplay. A good story mixed with intense action sequences and a large scope to set all of it up in. If this was going to be the last big title from Rockstar on this generation, what a helluva way to go out.", 
                "Editing the GTA formula has been done with love and care. Playing with no less than three main characters works well in every thinkable way, and after finishing the compelling and sharply written story, there’s enough to do in the wide world of Los Santos and environment. GTA 5 simply offers an ambitious, successful experience of a rare quality level.", 
                "San Andreas is vast and sprawling and so much fun to explore. There are thousands of things to do and hundreds of missions, so this will not be a quick playthrough.", 
                "Rockstar Games deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of its flagship franchise yet again with improved controls, great mission variety, and the most jam-packed open world I've ever visited.", 
                "Gigantic and stupidly detailed, GTA V is everything we hoped it would be. Individual components could be a touch better, but when a game does literally everything, nobody can expect perfection across the board. That it even comes close is incredible. [Issue#236, p.62]", 
                "An absolute masterpiece that you can't miss: this is a perfect sequel in the GTA series.", 
                "The long-awaited fifth episode in Rockstar's extremely popular franchise delivers on all fronts. It's one of those rare games that does everything absolutely right and therefore a purchase is definitely in order. What are you waiting for?", 
                "Don't let the missing half-point fool you, Grand Theft Auto V is as good of a retail release you'll find this generation and an excellent coda to this generation for Rockstar.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is a gargantuan accomplishment, with an emphasis on the word “gargantuan.” It may still have an assortment of inconsistencies, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, but one could argue that such missteps still give this franchise a singular character.", 
                "Time just melted away as I lived a second, third, and fourth life in GTA V. The experience consists of more than just crimes. I played tennis, enrolled in a flight school, captured fugitives, watched movies, and towed cars. A lot of that doesn’t sound fun on paper, but they bring some semblance of real life to a world that otherwise runs on its own bizarre rules.", 
                "Whether you were burned by GTA 4 or not, GTA 5 remembers what the series is all about: emergent sandbox fun and a helluva a lot of murder. You need to play it.", 
                "These characters are voice-acted so annoyingly well that you almost wish the character would never speak again, just like some of the main characters. The music and talk shows are also great to listen to as you are traveling around. All in all, the sound department is not lacking in GTA V.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable achievement. Fun, challenging, satisfying and morally complex, it’s also proof of the ability of games to tackle mature subjects while still being enjoyable diversions, all in service to great characters and a gritty story.", 
                "All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is one of those majorly hyped titles that actually delivers.", 
                "The best way to bid farewell to the retiring consoles is to spend dozens of hours having fun in Los Santos: robbing, abusing illegal substances, breaking all laws and enjoying everything else that GTA V has to offer. And after we finish the game, we should all say loudly: ‘okay, Rockstar girls and boys, it’s high time to make a truly new GTA, not just a gigantic DLC’. [12/2013, p.36]", 
                "Rockstar put tons of time and effort into polishing its winning formula. It isn't a dramatic change for the series, but it's a more polished, and very enjoyable, addition to the franchise.", 
                "A compelling culmination of exact care and attention, Grand Theft Auto V's obsessive attention to detail is matched only by its gripping mission design and clever caricature cast.", 
                "If you’re absolutely opposed to torture, or you need a positive woman character in your game, Grand Theft Auto V is a complete non-starter...Despite my feelings about those things, however, I still found myself having fun outside of them. The rest of the game is good enough that I was up until 3:00 am one night playing mission after mission.", 
                "GTA5 may not be the Hollywood-beating crime story it wants to be, then, but it's the best video game it's ever been, and I'll take that.", 
                "GTA V is an imperfect yet astounding game that has great characters and an innovative and exciting narrative structure, even if the story it uses that structure to tell is hobbled at times by inconsistent character behavior, muddled political messages and rampant misogyny. It also raises the bar for open-world mission design in a big way and has one of the most beautiful, lively, diverse and stimulating worlds ever seen in a game."

To see every single corner of TLOU being so well thought and detailed was amazing and people must understand that to make those incredible details it takes a lot of money and a lot of incredibly talented people. With that been said, GTA V, in every corner, has that uniqueness.\rEverything has been reworked from GTA IV incorporating some of the traits of Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne, Manhunt.\rOk, that was the basic approach of Rockstar. Grand Theft Auto was never great for the story they told. Grand Theft Auto will never have the same level of emotional connection with the player like The Last of Us or Heavy Rain. But that is not a bad thing. With it's three characters, Rockstar tried to do exactly what Resident Evil 6 tried, diversify the boring gameplay of its predecessor (everyone knows GTA IV was basically \"go-kill-comeback\"). Now, GTA V is \"go-dosomething-comeback\". If you liked GTA IV's version of driving fidelity, you're gonna be disappointed, cause everything is way easier when it comes to cars. Shooting is easy and responsive, exactly like Max Payne 3's. Now let's get back to what really matters.\r If you're reading this deciding to buy GTA V, here's what you need to ponder.\rDo you care about story? What kind of story? Do you want to connect with the characters or just have a little laugh here and then?\rIf you're looking for deep, emotional story, GTA V is not for you\rDo you like complex characters? Or you rather have them all figured out from the gate?\rIf you like predictable characters. GTA V is for you. (ps: that is not a bad thing, it's just a way to the a story. If you like Harry Potter, to Lord of the Rings, to Batman, most of its characters are predictable)\rDo you like possibilities? The ability to do the same thing in a variety of ways?\rIf so, GTA V is your game.\rDo you care for multiplayer online?\rGTA Online will be a huge part of GTA V and it looks awesome.\rDo you have enough money to buy every single game you want to have?\rIf you have enough money for one game. GTA V is your game.\rWhy?\rIt has everything.\rIt's a shooter, with a fun yet sometimes a little shallow story, it's a racing game, a tennis game, a golf game, it's got everything from flying and skydiving to riding a submarine, from playing darts to banging hookers. You can buy cars, jets, boats, bikes, stocks, bars, movie theaters.\rIf you're a looking for the perfect metaphor for a game like GTA, you can find it in RPGs.\rGTA never wanted to be ONE thing, a wizard or a warrior, GTA tries to be everything, never being perfect in those things, but they have such talented people, time and a lot of money to be very, very good in those things.\rSo if you, like some people like to do, strip it down and analyze it piece by piece, GTA V probably will get poor grades. It is a lousy tennis game, a pathetic racing game...but GTA V is not anyone of those things. We are limited by the technology and the market to have a perfect game.\rThere will never be a game with open world meticulously created, that is also the biggest map ever, with deep, complex characters, living the greatest story ever told, while also being a Gran Turismo when you get a car, a Battlefield when you pull your gun...it is impossible.\rGTA V is a game that does nothing perfect, but trying to do everything it creates its own category, and even if it doesn't succeed at being perfect, it is so well thought and made, such care was put in every detail, that every other game could learn from it. GTA V is a 10/10 not because it is perfect, but because its flaws are the gap between genres. GTA V can be the single point from where all the other games branch out in a single direction and the others that try to compare and be everything just can't match this level of care.… Expand",

The graphic qualities are great, only made even better by the detailed lighting. The sheen on a car or the blurring of light in the background are stellar and  make everything feel true to life.\rThe story is an obvious. Rockstar pumps out another quality script, putting satire to good use. It did, however, feel strange and a little disturbing to have no outward motive to rob banks other than just wanting money. These guys aren't anti-heroes, they're just villains, albeit extremely likable. It plays with your perception of right and wrong.\rThere are a few nit picks I have, but they honestly can be overlooked for the most part.\rTHIS IS WHAT A GAME CAN BE WHEN DEVELOPERS ARE GIVEN PROPER TIME.

I saw a lot of people on here day 1 of the game's release bashing it when they didn't even have a good amount of play time put into the game. I have put 25 hours in to the game so far, and I still feel like there's so much more for me to see and do. From the get go, you can already see how much there is to explore. I was initially disappointed the city portion of the map was  small in comparison to the rest of the map, but when you're in the game it feels like a large, full sized city. The game gives you a lot to do, as there are multiple side missions, random encounters with people getting robbed or having their bike get stolen, and it even lets you invest in the stock market. The biggest changes in this entry would be the shooting and driving mechanics. Everything has been tweaked and feels tighter and much more responsive. Vehicles don't swerve all over the road like in GTA IV, and the shooting is heavily borrowed from Rockstar's own Max Payne 3 which is a good thing. The stories for the three main characters are all really interesting. The characters themselves live very different lives, which helps make the missions more varied. That is perhaps one of the best improvements of the new game, is that the missions are now much more varied. Nearly every mission is different from the last, and it helps keep the game interesting. The biggest missions in the game are these elaborate heists, in which the player actually gets to choose between two options of how they want to go through a heist, and who they to go through heist with as their crew. These are the highlights of the game in terms of missions and they near always give the user some much needed cash as there is a lot to spend your money on in this game.  For the first time in a GTA game, you can actually buy a vehicle legally, through the game's internet, and it will be delivered to your garage. Vehicle customization and character customization are both back from San Andreas. The car customization, while not very extensive as far as what you can do to the body, is fun and lets you have your own custom car, as well as letting you improve the vehicle's performance. The game is a lot of fun, and despite some texture glitches here and there and some frame-rate slow down, it is as near perfect of a game as a sandbox could ever hope to be.

                "GTA V  A Bright New Future\r For me I have always loved Grand Theft Auto games, my first game being Vice City, and then going back in the series to GTA 3, and then of course San Andreas and GTA 4. I have always gone back to Vice City when wanting to play a bit of casual GTA. For me Vice City was a hassle free fun open world game at the time something really quite special, from the musicGTA V  A Bright New Future\r For me I have always loved Grand Theft Auto games, my first game being Vice City, and then going back in the series to GTA 3, and then of course San Andreas and GTA 4. I have always gone back to Vice City when wanting to play a bit of casual GTA. For me Vice City was a hassle free fun open world game at the time something really quite special, from the music to the cars to the compelling story line it has always been a deep rooted personal best when it comes to gaming. Most recently in the series GTA 4 was impressive the new world was a tall new world and was exciting to explore, but it always felt 'dark' to me, there's no other way to explain it, just 'dark'.\r So when I saw the gameplay and trailers of the latest development of Grand Theft Auto from Rockstar I was excited, it seemed they were really taking a massive leap forward in the open world game. And when I received my game today my expectations were met. The game is bright and open, the map is dense yet personal, getting to know the areas around Michael's and Franklin's house's has been a joy. The city feels alive, the free ways feel real, and the desserts are superb to explore.\r The brightness has well and truly been turned up, but it's not just the stunning graphics and huge new world we have to enjoy. We now have three characters, to begin with it felt complex and slightly annoying having to switch characters in high octane situations, but bit by bit, mission by mission it's starting to feel a little more fluid, I'm not there yet and it still feels slightly confusing, but I am sure as the missions get more complex the enjoyment from switching perspectives will increase. The three characters are so different and interesting in their different ways. I must admit I wasn't massively looking forward to playing with Trevor but his 'different' personality has become something you just want to explore more and more. Michael continues to be my favoured character. I really enjoyed the growing dynamic of Franklin and Michael, and seeing it develop into the first heist was great.\r I have enjoyed the driving and find the mechanics enjoyable and realistic, I can see why some do not like these, but I just think it's a case of getting used to it. There are so many different cars and other road traffic to see and drive. I thought the amount of different looking buses was amazing, as small a detail as it may be it just felt nothing had been ignored. The roads are highly detailed in the city, and feel real to real life cities roads the road markings for example have been developed further. In addition the road driving AI are much more realistic and add to the experience.\r The missions are different and interesting, however can sometimes be slightly tedious and mundane but still excite in many areas. And it's all worth it for the heists, were I thought they freedom given to players is a class act from Rockstar. I was also very impressed with how choosing different crew members not only had a real difference on the outcome but also a difference on the dialogue between characters, very interesting indeed!\r The small mini games are fun and put GTA into a league of it's own. I loved the triathlon game and am looking forward to developing my skills further. Tennis and Yoga also exsist. With access to stock markets and transport and real estate markets adding an extra dimension to an already jam-packed game. With GTA you really do get a full game, there is no skimping from Rockstar, no corner cutting, and it is fully worth their long waits between games, when you get such a polished and finished game.\r For me Grand Theft Auto is the pinnacle of gaming, it is a game that has thought of just about everything, Rockstar haven't rushed a game out to try and make money with minimal improvements (Saints Row 4 springs to mind here) They have spent a great deal of time and money and resources to making a stunning looking, and compelling to play gameplay. For me GTA is the best all round game I have ever played, it perhaps doesn't come close to other games in certain areas, for example dialogues and emotion goes to The Last of Us. But Rockstar have delivered on what were monumental expectations, for me GTA V will always go down as a game changer. It's very fitting that perhaps the best game ever of this current generation will be this generations swan song. It's been a long ride Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 but we meet the end of the road with this amazing ending. Rockstar have excelled as per usual.… Expand",

I have been completing side missions and story missions pretty much evenly paced. Let me just say this, I love this game, it is one of the best, ever.\rBut, there ARE some issues with it: First off, the graphics. They could be better, not on the PS3 or X360, then again my personal opinion is it should have been released for next gen, not current. The graphics are nice, don't get me wrong, but in this game the limitations of the hardware being used is the most apparent, ever.\rSecond off: The map is huge, Ill give it that, but it I had been led to believe that there was more to be done. I don't know what I feel is missing, but something is missing, there are loads of side quests, I agree, but after one, two or three they all drop to a single common denominator, and it becomes just a thing to do. Entirely skippable, which I guess side missions would be, but I desired a bit more oomph.\rThird off: Controls; now for the most part the controls work, and work really well. But sometimes, and by sometimes it feels often since it is ALWAYS at the worst possible time it could happen, they  up. Your character will spasm or do something you did NOT tell him to do, and then your dead. Not that dying really matters, 5grand and your good to go again, you'll even keep your weapons, but lose your car.\rFourth: Cars don't get properly saved, so I have wasted a good 100k bucks on fitting and refitting cars, just to have them disappear, apparently rockstar is on the bug and will have a fix for it soon.\r Might seem overly critical, but in essence, these are minor things, at least for me, still felt they were worth mentioning. If you, like me, find that these things are minor, then get the game now. GTA V scores heavily on story, audio (VA included), gameplay (by and large, most control mechanics work really well, except for on foot and the ****ing choppers), size and scope, and also the idea of three protagonists.

                "It has such an enormous amount to offer (did I even mention the two player option?) and carries everything off with such confidence and style that it's hard to fault.", 
                "It's not just the best Grand Theft Auto to date, it's possibly the best game you'll ever play on PlayStation 2. It's simply that good.", 
                "A manifesto for every future video game. Now we've seen what can be done when truly brilliant people get to make a world brimming with variety, music, humour and sheer scale, very few other games are going to be able to live up to it. [PSW]", 
                "I can't express in words to do the game justice how large and well drawn out these cities are.", 
                "A game that surpasses its genre-defining predecessors in every respect, not just in terms of gameplay, but also in terms of story, characters, and overall fun. It pops many caps in many asses. [Jan 2005, p.58]", 
                "So good that it even drew Axl Rose out of hiding (he’s the DJ on the classic rock station, one of 11 listening formats), San Andreas cranks out even more action than \"Vice City\" as you engage in those wacky gang-related adventures you've grown to love in disconcertingly authentic versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.", 
                "Take a large measure of \"GTA III\"; add a sprinkle of \"Vice City\", freshly sliced sprigs of nineties gang culture; stir in dashes of \"Manhunt\", \"Fable\", and \"Dance-Dance Revolution\" to taste, then mix in a nitro-powered-blender from hell. Result? Ten out of ten.", 
                "It's like 5 games in one: part RPG, part adventure, part action, part racer and part sim. And it does it just as well as the best games in any of those genres...One of the best games ever released on any system.", 
                "Somehow, Rockstar keeps the same old ingredients, adds a handful of new ones, and manages to create a great new recipe. [Feb 2005, p.NP-9]", 
                "Non-linear, absolutely packed with things to do, entertaining radio stations, great missions, great story, great characters, enough diversions to keep you playing for months, so much diversity in the cities that you may never stop discovering new aspects of town.", 
                "But don’t forget we’re gamers, and you can be sure that if we get on two knees and kiss some ass, it’s not because we’re paid to, it’s because we’ve just played the kind of game that reminds us why we’re doing this in the first place.", 
                "What does make it great is that it actually delivers on nearly everything it promises while still being fun to just pick up and play.", 
                "Massively expansive, even over \"Vice City.\" The biggest game ever. [Jan 2007, p.106]", 
                "San Andreas breaks the video game mold and emerges as something far greater. This is more than a game. This is entertainment at its best. [Dec 2004, p.170]", 
                "A masterpiece; the outstanding gameplay from the first two games has been extended, tweaked and applied to a fresh, original and fascinating setting. There's more than enough meat to keep you going for months, and the sheer variety of gameplay is bewildering.", 
                "Not only a masterpiece, it's the finest game currently available for the PS2. Buy it now, but don't make any plans for a couple months at least.", 
                "A true platform defining title; in 20 years time gamers will look back at the Playstation2 and hold GTA: San Andreas as the true epoch-making title of the times. Nothing can be understated, RockStar North have truly delivered beyond everybody’s expectations.", 
                "San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there's plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience...Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes.", 
                "The best game on the PS2.", 
                "The graphical effects in this title are far superior to anything GTA conjured up previously. On hot days you'll see an intense heat in front of you in the form of lots and lots of orange sunlight and heat waves in the distance. The sunsets and sunrises during hot times are absolutely blinding!", 
                "I usually complain that many single player games these days do not have much in the way of \"replayability\". That is one aspect where San Andreas sets the bar so ridiculously high, that I can't imagine any non-GTA games coming anywhere near it for years to come.", 
                "Freedom has always been the GTA hallmark, and in that regard, San Andreas piles on the features to ludicrous proportions. Comparing San Andreas to any other game is like comparing King Kong to the other monkeys; it is the Overgame.", 
                "There really is no other game like it, despite there being many imitators, and this is precisely the kind of experience that reminds why, exactly, we play games: to be liberated from the constraints of reality, and explore living, breathing worlds. Few games have come this close to realizing that promise.", 
                "Once again, Rockstar Games and Rockstar North have changed gaming as we know it...The variety of missions in San Andreas is staggering, as there's literally hundreds of varied tasks that will help you gain respect.", 
                "Despite minor flaws, this is by far the most enjoyable game in the GTA series, and will eat well over 100 hours of your time.", 
                "The word “massive” doesn’t begin to describe the entire state of San Andreas and exploring it without any load times is like the cherry on top of an overly sweetened cake.  Driving has been tightened to perfection and the changes to the targeting system makes popping caps on fools so much better.", 
                "It's about being in one long and deeply worthwhile experience that manages to do the impossible and improve on what has gone before, and then has the confidence to expand itself to a size that defies belief. Pack some sandwiches, it's going to be a long trip.", 
                "In short, it's a terrific unending masterpiece of a game -- and one that will never fall victim to an over-exaggeration of its lofty status. It's the defining piece of software for Sony's successful sophomore system, and it's almost impossible to imagine a PlayStation 2 library without it.", 
                "Shudderingly comprehensive, divinely paced and - despite the million of words already written in feverish anticipation - it has the ability to surprise at every turn. This is PS2's defining masterpiece – a sunspot of rare polished magic from experienced developers working at the peak of their powers. [PSM2]", 
                "Play mechanics, the movie-epic plot, the sheer scope of the landscape and the missions—all combine to create the most near-perfect experience that I have ever had with a game.", 
                "Without a doubt the greatest game every created on the Playstation 2 videogame system. It is the best hands-down. No other game can come even close to this one...The possibilities of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas are endless.", 
                "A stunning achievement for both Rockstar and Sony. It shows just how powerful the PS2 system is when used right. This game has the potential to last months and months on end, especially for the 100% target.", 
                "The story to San Andreas is by far the best of any GTA game to date. As you progress, you will experience turning points to this story that drive you to see the next cutscene, something that has never been done in a GTA game before.", 
                "The game’s targeting system has been improved and is very reminiscent of the developer’s \"Manhunt,\" which overall makes it more cohesive. The game allows you to get better with guns and you’ll have different phases, which will give you more control over your shooting abilities.", 
                "While I can't say that GTA: San Andreas is another revolution in gaming like GTA3 was, it is an evolution that goes light years beyond what we saw with the last two titles in the series.", 
                "Only the graphical bugs, slow-down and other nit picks associated with the fact that the game is pushing the aging PS2 to its limits keeps this from being the first perfect entry into the series.", 
                "Thanks to the sheer level of detail and the amount of gameplay you'll be able to engage in during C.J.'s adventures, San Andreas surpasses just about any game that’s come along in the PS2’s history.", 
                "The amount of attributes that you can actually improve is staggering. CJ must learn how to drive, shoot, swim, workout, be healthy, sprint and participate in relationships.", 
                "With its strong story, well-written dialogue, terrific voice cast, impressive graphics, great in-game sound, and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.", 
                "This could very well be remembered as the PlayStation 2's best game ever.", 
                "As far as actual content goes, I don’t think there’s been a game in history with more, so you almost need to own this game just so you can see how packed a game can be.", 
                "When you take the scope of the entire game into considerations, San Andreas is a real technical feat.", 
                "It is hard to find a game with the perfect blend of unique, action packed missions and interesting and enthralling non-mission events, but Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas pulls it off in convincing fashion.", 
                "There's so much to do in this game that it's outside of my range of imagination to be able to picture me reaching a 100% complete. Unfathomable.", 
                "The second you start playing this game you realise that the latest Rockstar title is about a hundred times more complex than its predecessors. Not only is there a load of new weapons, cars and a huge new environment available, but the gaming experience itself has completely evolved.", 
                "It is, in my opinion, the best single player experience available right now.", 
                "A weaker soundtrack and nagging problems with the interface take the game down just shy of getting a full 10, but this is the digital embodiment of a killer app.", 
                "Calling this game huge is an understatement...All told, San Andreas is about four times the size of any previous GTA game.", 
                "This is arguably the most important videogame this year - yes, even more important than \"Halo 2\" - not only because it's a superbly crafted videogame, but because it's also a bona fide sociological artifact, one that manages to effectively evoke a specific time and place in American history—in this case, a hot and hazy California during the nascent days of hip-hop culture.", 
                "The minor control problems, reoccurring graphical bugs, and the generally similar core gameplay as before keep the game's score down a tad from what it could be, but the ridiculous amount of content and pure value available here is second to none. It doesn’t completely redefine the series.", 
                "A masterful blend of storyline, exciting action, and freeform gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours on end.", 
                "There is personality and atmosphere everywhere in this game and even small things such as the body language of pedestrians sets the scene in every neighbourhood you visit.", 
                "Surprisingly easy to pick up, and startlingly difficult to master, San Andreas offers the most complete gaming package ever made on the current generation of consoles.", 
                "No one should deny that San Andreas is a great storytelling game. It's just that, between gradually caring less and less about the main characters, and performing many game actions that are nearly identical to those of previous titles in the series, San Andreas could easily begin to wear a bit thin.", 
                "This game has so many new innovations that it leaves its predecessors in the dust.", 
                "My biggest beef with San Andreas is the implementation of the gang warfare system...It takes away a certain element that was found in the earlier games, that of the feeling that you were running an entire city.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is to the gaming world what \"The Matrix\" was to the film industry: it breaks so much ground and introduces so many significant things that it will no doubt have an impact on how games are made for a long time to come.", 
                "GTA may be looking its age and some of its more favoured structural ideas are beginning to feel a little dated, but Rockstar continue to revel in the mastery of presenting a consuming environment to the player and inviting them to do within it what they wish.", 
                "San Andreas's chief advantage over \"Vice City\" is size. And for many players, that's good enough. But another group of fans will come to quietly understand that, at least for the time being, \"Vice City\" remains the high point of the GTA series.", 
                "The fact that you can do whatever you want, gunning down rival gang members, impressing the girls, robbing the rich, breaking into the Army Depot, whether it is flying a plane, or pimping out your car, playing some pool, riding across country, the game play is endless.", 
                "As with previous GTA games there's lots to criticise, but San Andreas survives, scathed but still walking tall, buoyed by the kind of ambition that sees most games crumble under the weight of it all. It's a multi-faceted, multi-achieving experience, a rough-edged but massively substantial landmark. [Christmas 2004, p.78]", 
                "I have to subtract a point for what, in my opinion, is a total lack of overall upgrading. While there are hundreds of more things to do in San Andreas, I feel, in my heart of hearts, that the game looks and plays just like its two predecessors.", 
                "One of the game's biggest achievements, however, is that it actually gets you to care about Carl and his friends - the other gang members who ride and fight with you on most missions. They all seem to have their own personalities and come across as being fully-realized characters.", 
                "There is also a distinct lack of overall polish, mostly noticeable in the smallest ways: ugly character models, cluttered maps (the custom waypoint is a welcomed and downright necessary addition), unnecessarily complex wardrobe management, odd misspellings (\"Cobra Marital Arts\"), and even repeated references to Los Angeles instead of Los Santos.", 
                "San Andreas' greatest success is that it gives us more space for our imaginations than most other games do, and ties together the edges neatly with a well-crafted story and missions, adding up to a whole that few games can compare to.", 
                "San Andreas is a true epic, but no game should be this frustrating.", 
                "The seamless way in which the DJs react to the in-game environment, and from an intertextual standpoint, merge better with the player's situation far more effectively than in the previous games is just inspiring.", 
                "Enormous, diverse, engrossing, daring, liberating, sophisticated and -- most of all -- ambitious. Yet at the same time it can be restrictive, banal, childish, unpolished and -- most of all -- frustrating.", 
                "What you have here is the most polished, feature-laden, action-packed Grand Theft Auto title to-date. I've had my qualms with the franchise in the past but this is the first time that I was able to sit back, shut off my brain and enjoy the experience.", 
                "Between its towering mountains and vast waters there are surprises, in-jokes and events in San Andreas to fill at least a hundred hours. Should \"GTA4\" be any more involving, there’ll be no one left to see how GTA5 turns out. Half of us will no longer have the jobs to afford it; the other half will be motoring back and forth in the neighbours’ stolen car, endlessly prowling for prostitutes.", 
                "It's no exaggeration to say that you could be still be playing this when the next GTA game comes out, even if it takes Rockstar another two years to finish. It's not perfect then, but so much of it is so good that you won't care.", 
                "Your legacy will be as twisted, as exciting or as brutal as your imagination will allow... San Andreas is an experience as unique as you are. Sometimes, it’s okay to believe the hype. [Christmas 2004, p.98]", 
                "The amount of things to do in the cities of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas is absolutely staggering... In my opinion there’s no excuse to not have a “save anywhere” feature included.", 
                "Bigger and richer in every way - a near bottomless game painted end-to-end with stuff to do, or not. As far as free-form gaming goes, it remains the pinnacle. [Jan 2005, p.57]", 
                "A thrilling, albeit frustrating, gaming experience that will have you yelling for joy one minute then screaming in anger the next.", 
                "Visually, San Andreas is pretty lackluster. The game doesn't display a single \"wow\" element in its visuals. The framerate is still too jerky and the pop-up is absolutely disastrous.", 
                "How can a rehash of the same basic formula prove so successful? As GTA:SA has taught me, one does so by taking the best parts of a given game, improving them, and then adding a ridiculous amount of new features and content."

The map is huge, and even the most dedicated gamer would take days to fully explore all the locations. There are three large cities each based on Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas. There is also an impressive countryside and a desert as well. Many characters are featured throughout, some who return from GTA 3 and Vice City. The vehicles are standard GTA fare, but there are also lots of planes, helicopters and many unique vehicles as well such as the army tank, the quadbike and even a fighter plane.

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, at time of writing, is very old. I played it too much upon release, and even today I still find time to boot up my PS2 between next-gen games, and play this classic. Apart from rather bad graphics, which were mostly down to an old engine, aging hardware, and disc limitations of the time, San Andreas would score high on the charts of any generic rating system. It took the already well established, if slightly repetitive formula of it's predecessor, Vice City, and expanded, refreshed, and improved every aspect. Each gameplay detail was refined, although the basic GTA formula stayed in place. This left some core elements some gamers would dislike, but the masses, the critics, and myself, couldn't get enough of the best offering the GTA series had to offer. Storyline, audio, presentation, all packaged into a game where, with a little progression, you could unlock many more locations, vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements (Who could forget the jetpack in all it's obscure glory?) than many other games of the time, made GTA one of the best games ever developed for the PS2 system. If you've been living on Mars with your hands over your eyes and ears for the past 7 years,  or by some miracle missed this title, It's worth picking up on disc for a PC, or preferably console, at bargain prices.

The game's map is just ginormous consisting of three cities Los Santos (based on LA), San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas). The large map also has forest and desert like environments it is amazing how this game captured the feel of three different cities and its citizens but also shows the way the cowboys and villiagers live their loves in the forest and the desert. GTA San Andreas has just a great story which could be confusing early on however the player will understand more and more things as he progresses the game's story is very deep, enthralling and personal also more involving and darker than its predecessors. I also like the main character of this game Carl Johnson he has a very funny. charming and likeable personality a type of person who can be sarcastic and funny along with being a total bada** and serious at the same time. The game also includes some rpg stats unlike 3 and Vice City which include Respect, Fat, Muscle that can change the way CJ looks. The player can also buy different kinds of clothes , different haircuts and tattoos to make the CJ look exactly like he wants, the player can also customize and mod different Vehicles the customization options in this game are just really well done, Sex Appeal, Driving and Gun Skills/Stats have also been implemented in the game the more player drives and the more he uses guns his skills improve and the better the player gets at them for example the player will be able to drive cars easily when his skills improve, and being able to use two SMGS at the same time and move while shooting as the player gets good with guns. The game has so much side stuff that it is impossible for me to cover in all of them in this review but the ones on the top of my head are: car, bike and plane races, car, bike, boat and plane schools, GYMs, girlfriends, gang Wars, Casinos, Quarry missions, some Asset missions as well as Police, Taxi and Ambulance missions thats not even all. The amount of side stuff put the side things in GTA 4 to shame. GTA San Andreas also has great music and songs which are all a great kickback to the 1990s and all the types of music are there Rock Music, Country Music, Rap Music and even talk shows infact the player can just enjoy and have fun in the game driving around in cars and bikes while listening to these Radio Stations alone thats how awesome the Radio Stations are in this game. The voice acting is just perfect there is no other word I can use to describe it, it seems like all the people who are doing the voice acting are deep into their characters. The game's graphics are good considering its ps2, the game is so huge and it came out in 2004 so its graphics are understandable, the environments looks just beautiful, character models are more detailed than previous GTAs but the characters stiff finger attached hands can look really weird at times. There is a multiplayer mode in this game unlike previous GTAs while it is not amazing or anything the player can still have alot of fun with his friends while free roaming with them or doing co-op rampage missions it is not perfect but it is better to have a multiplayer mode which is fun but not perfect than have no multiplayer at all. The game's story is around 25-30 hours long however in trying to do all the sidestuff in this and unlocking all things, getting 100% completion the player can spend hours and hours in this game and completely get lost in it amazing world and atmosphere.

And Rockstar Games did it in 13.9 square miles. That's small, however the destiny makes it feel massive. The drawn distance did really ruin the experience though. The gang mechanics were sort of spot on (Had it's flaws) but it's a game from 2004, so I'm not complaining. The customization was taken to the next level. No GTA so far has been able to match the customization of San Andreas. From weight lifting, to abilties, to gaining weight losing weight, to learning new fighting styles, to customizing your car, different types of clothing, etc. I would say the customization was the best part of the gang.

I remember very well when this game came out: everyone talked about it, everyone praised it, everyone wanted it, and everyone had it. Many players had appreciated San Andreas because you could do what you wanted and because it was full of cheats. I agree about the freedom the game give you, and yes, cheats were really beautiful and fun.\r But what lies beneath San Andreas is something much deeper and bigger. The setting was magnificent, set in the fictional state of San Andreas. Not to mention the historical context of the early 90s (it was set in 1992), with a fantastic background of uses and costumes, such as music, vehicles, weapons and clothes of that time. The plot was magnificent, rich in actuality as gang warfare, drugs, corruption, shootouts, bank robberies and even more that slowly drag the player down to the slums of the 90s. Among other things, the plot was rooted upon real events as the \"East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry\" and the \"Rampart scandal\". Things that still today have their weight on culture and on contemporary history.\r The gameplay of San Andreas was great: you could do whatever you wanted, right from the start. You could go where you wanted, and turn around the entire map, which was also quite large. You had to eat and drink, or you could go to the gym, or you could gamble, or you could have a girlfriend, or you could kill anyone you wanted also. You could change your clothes and also (and this is not possible in other GTA games) change your appearance, become leaner, more fat, more muscular. You could develop your skills with weapons or driving vehicles. Indeed, from a point of view of gameplay, San Andreas is the deeper and complete chapter of the entire serie, and it felt just like a real rpg-game.\r The graphics of San Andreas was not as beautiful as God of War and Metal Gear Solid, however, was more than acceptable and some views as the one of Vinewood were really fascinating.\r What else to say? Nothing, except that I recommend this game to anyone, and I consider him a true timeless masterpiece and an important legacy of the early 2000s.

Only the 1st score recorded for the day is stored - preventing you from scoring higher (in Memory Game for sure!) through familiarity of repeated playing. But it works and as it should be : instant scoring at first try - no honing your memory skills by playing warm-up rounds - what you score is a true representative of the state of alertness and mind when you sit for the test on each day. But as the previous reviewer said : the game really comes alive when shared with a few people. After a few days it will get darn competitive and you feel the pressure and heat constantly ON to outdo the competition. And I am a Sudoku freak. This beats the LCD Sudoku currently on the market hands-down with the ability to write small notes. Just the way Sudoku should be played. Another showpiece title for DS without a doubt.… Expand",

The way the big N has set up the cartridges to make the multiple save slots work together to make it feel like everyone is competing even though there is no simultaneous play is quite smart!

Sudoku.The Bad: Sometimes it just can't recognize your handwriting, and losing points for that is EXTREMELY frustrating; graphs are limited to one month per time, so you can't follow your progress in a long term; normal and hard modes are mixed in one graph, making your average fall when you try the hard mode.Good brain training programs, an overall delightful bright sound and the funny doctor's head floating around the screen don't keep Brain Age from being frustrating.The major problem here is the not-always-good handwriting recognizing system. Every now and then you'll find yourself scratching the screen here and there while watching the time going by without being understood; or being misunderstood, resulting in lost points anyway. In a nutshell, the pieces fall apart because of a structural defect.A little extra encouragement would have been nice too--like giving prizes for reaching higher age levels or completing sudoku--but it's not there. Add to that the disheartening mix between normal and hard modes in the graphs generation and we've got more problems than qualities.On the other hand some training programs like Low to High and Head Count and some tests from the brain age check feature like Connect Maze work pretty fine and are well-executed ideas, but that only sum up for a final disappointment feeling.In the end there's only a bitter taste in your mouth because it's easy to recognize a good opportunity wasted under technical issues.… Expand"
