                "Just as a Nintendo 64 without \"Super Mario 64\" was unthinkable, so too is a Wii without Wii Sports. It’s one of the most perfect launch games we’ve seen.", 
                "In terms of control and immersion, Wii Sports destroys the competition and provides an excellent foundation for other developers to build upon.", 
                "Wii Sports is the perfect pack-in for the Wii since it really shows off the system’s unique capabilities and manages to draw in casual gamers who would otherwise not want to play videogames.", 
                "The game does a great job of showing off what the system is about and showcasing the system’s abilities.", 
                "We can't help but enjoy the fact that we're getting a solid sports experience for nothing. It's definitely more fun in groups and won't have a great deal of longevity, but anyone who doesn't find at least some fun in Wii Sports has a heart of coal.", 
                "Sure, it lacks goals and can be beaten very quickly. But the ultra-responsive technology and high multiplayer replay value are far greater than any other party or sports game collection.", 
                "The single-player game is good for practice and daily tests, but Wii Sports shines as a multiplayer game. [Jan. 2007, p.96]", 
                "It's bloody good fun and you'll enjoy playing it for ages. [January 2007, p.38]", 
                "It's a game you can play with your friends and family, and it perfectly highlights the direction that Nintendo is taking with the platform. It's not the best-looking game on the system, and it's definitely not the deepest, but it may well be the most fun.", 
                "This is a simple game about simple fun, and everyone owes it to themselves to try it out to get a taste for what the Wii may in fact have in store for us all very soon.", 
                "A couple of the games are rewarding for the long term, but most can be easily whipped into submission in a matter of hours. The visuals are also severely lacking.", 
                "Wii Sports certainly won't be hailed as the most realistic sports sim on the market, but it's the best thing - next to a bottle of tequila - to take to a friend's holiday house party.", 
                "The game's meant to be a no-frills, no-pressure entry point into the Wii and its bizarre new way of playing videogames, and it's impressive that it manages to be a lot of fun at the same time.", 
                "More fun than a box of ferrets and almost genius, but it feels just a bit too slapdash. [Christmas 2006, p.64]", 
                "It may not win any awards for the best looking or sounding game but it's great pure fun, and is instantly accessible to pretty much anyone.", 
                "Brilliantly embodies the Wii's dramatic premise: that this kind of control can appeal to people who don't play games and people who used to play games as well as people who've been playing them for as long as we have.", 
                "Despite the shortcomings in presentation and pruning in some aspects of the modes and play, what Wii Sports gets right it gets right with flying colors, showing that what may have appeared as a gimmick - the motion-reading controllers - is actually a revolution.", 
                "Highly approachable and hugely entertaining for all ages, Wii Sports serves as a great introduction and advertisement for the innovative Wii motion-sensing controller.", 
                "It’s simple, addictive, compelling and innovative all rolled into one.", 
                "It’s accessible, addictive, and an excellent tech-demo for the Wii-mote, not to mention an obvious choice to whip out when you want to show off your new purchase.", 
                "A massive, massive success as a launch title. Ignore the negativity you may have heard, and embrace this marvellous new bit of kit into your home.", 
                "Wii Sports makes for an ideal pack-in with Nintendo's new console, providing some fun, simple gameplay that's accessible to almost anyone.", 
                "For a free game that’s included with the system, we couldn’t be happier. We hope that Nintendo expands on the Bowling, Baseball, and Tennis games and tweaks Golf for future releases because they have a real winner on their hands.", 
                "With the exception of Boxing, everything in Wii Sports is entertaining, and there's a little more depth than the simplistic presentation might lead you to believe.", 
                "Despite these two solo modes, Wii Sports is really all about getting some friends together and playing a few matches of tennis or bowling. The game isn't designed to be a true authentic sports simulation, it's all about the sheer entertainment value, and this is where Wii Sports really shines.", 
                "Your non-gamer friends will be dazzled by the immediately intuitive controls and the imported Miis. But the title sacrifices incredible depth and visuals for an immediately accessible experience.", 
                "The bottom line, really, is that Wii Sports, as a multiplayer game, is downright fun. Whether your thing is tennis, baseball, golf, bowling or boxing, you’re bound to be smiling - at least for a few seconds - while playing Wii Sports.", 
                "If I had to pay for them, I probably wouldn't, but as a freebie included with the system, they're great for showcasing the system's capabilities and give all of the people in your household a chance to game — even those with no previous experience!", 
                "Create your Mii and challenge your friends (both gaming and non-gaming) to a game of bowling. I guarantee they’ll be hooked and so will you.", 
                "A very solid first effort for the Wii, and provides just a taste of what is, and what will be, great about the Wii console. Pick it up, play it and have fun. Very nice.", 
                "This is one you can feel confident about showing your family and friends who are normally saying things like \"pish-tosh\" when you bring up video games.", 
                "Wii Sports is all about showing what Nintendo's newest console an do in terms of innovation and making gaming accessible to everyone and overall it does a great job of this.", 
                "For the hardcore there’s not much here that you’ll be playing for more than an hour other than the training mode which gives you a lot of challenges but ultimately falls flat.", 
                "While the game isn’t exactly deep, who cares? It’s free and it’s fun; and that’s all that matters.", 
                "Who needs the outside world when you can get some decent exercise in your very living room or bedroom? It may not be anything rigorous, but it'll get your body moving in ways that it normally may not.", 
                "This glorified tech demo is an excellent game for groups, whether the serious gamers you'd expect from a college dorm or the kids at a family reunion.", 
                "Perfect? No. Indispensable? Yes. Wii Sports more than earns its bundled place as an essential component of the hardware. [Christmas 2006, p.76]", 
                "Wii Sports is neither bulging in features nor graphically impressive, but when you put everything together, you have a fun package that, although better in places than others, is varied enough to keep you entertained for a good while and brilliant in multiplayer.", 
                "In Wii Sports, innovation and gameplay triumph over substance, graphics, and depth, a feat which only Nintendo could accomplish.", 
                "Still, as a pack-in, it's hard to take pot-shots at a game that so perfectly acclimates users to the new control. [Jan. 2007, p.76]", 
                "Gamestyle still has concerns over the longevity of what could be a glorified Wiimote training session; but we were surprised at how much fun is here for the short term at least. It’s shallow, yet immensely playable, and a great introduction to this revolutionary system.", 
                "You can’t expect too much from a pack-in game, and Wii Sports is no exception. While it’s true that you will probably have a good time with one or two of the activities presented on this disc, it’s just as likely that you’ll get bored of them after only a few plays and never touch them again.", 
                "It gives gamers a small taste of what the WiiMote can do for their gaming experiences and a reason to keep playing the new system, but nothing more. Its appeal and flaws lay with its simplicity.", 
                "As a demo that gives a glimpse into the Wii's gaming future, Wii Sports is reassuring, charming, and good, clean fun.", 
                "None of these sports are fully fleshed out, and they simply represent a range of motions to perform with the controller.", 
                "The greatest strength of Wii Sports—its unparalleled accessibility—ends up being its greatest weakness. Although the game initially feels like a breath of fresh air, the failure of its novel control scheme to provide the sensitivity needed for continued growth and mastery ultimately sucks much of that air right back out.", 
                "I like the concept behind this pack-in, but Wii Sports simply ends up being an overly publicized demo. [Jan. 2007, p.63]", 
                "Despite control issues Wii Sports is probably one of the only launch titles that offers so much fun from such a small package.", 
                "In its 'free' state, Wii Sports is a triumph when presenting the abilities of your new console, but in reality, it's an extended victory for the console itself and not praise that should be bestowed upon the game. [Christmas 2006, p.106]"

            "description": "Tennis (1-4 players): Players grab the controller like a racket and swing – the game will register forehands, backhands, volleys, lobs, slices, spin and power depending on how fast the user swings and at what angle. Don't worry about moving around the court to get to the ball – the game automatically moves players into position. Baseball (1-2 players): Grip the controller like a bat and swat fastballs out of the park in a home run derby. Timing and bat speed will make all the difference between going yard and whiffing, so keep an eye on the ball and swing for the fences. In the two-player game, one player pitches and the other bats. Golf (1 player): Step up to the tee, hold the controller like a golf club and swing naturally to smack the ball onto the green. The harder players swing the club, the farther the ball will fly, so be sure to take some practice swings before going for the pin. After reaching the green, line up putts carefully, practice the stroke and try to hole out. [Nintendo]",

Strangely enough, boxing is the game that everyone that has played with me loves the most - one person even said that it was a good workout! Tennis is good, but it's also pretty easy. Bowling is really really fun, basically because it's just like real bowling. Since I only have one wii-mote it's the only game that I can play multiplayer with my friends (golf too, but... no). But what is giving me the most replay value is the fitness test. Strangely enough, the fact that you're limited to do it once a day entices me to do it even more! All in all, single player value comes from the tennis regular game, the fitness test, and a few of the training games. Multiplayer replay value comes from bowling and perhaps boxing.… Expand",

Looking on the positive side, it is an excellent choice for a party game and should be played with more than one person. It could easily be a replacement for a board game on game night with your family. Basically, it was fun with friends while it lasted. Now, we look at the negative side. The biggest problem is the fact that you are made fully aware you are playing a video game, as opposed to an actual sport. For example, in tennis, you frequently miss balls that got past you because the computer didn't move you fast enough across the court. My sister and I found a what we call \"cheat spot\" in tennis where when you get served on the right side of the court, if you aim for the far left side the other player cannot reach the ball in time. What a flaw! Couldn't they just let you be able to override your character's movement with the D-pad? Furthermore, every game is based solely on timing and placement and not on any type of physics. It feels broken and unresponsive. The best sports being tennis, bowling, and baseball (in that order); and the worst being golf and boxing (in that order). The best of sports are that way because they at least feel slightly more real than the worst of sports. Also, playing for a while can make your hands sweat. Sweaty hands equal slippage of the Wii remote. That can obviously equal broken plasmas (trust me, just Google \"wii remote tv damage\"). This happens often in tennis and baseball. I was lucky I missed my flat screen and created a crater in the wall to the side of it, instead. It is not totally the game's fault, I am just warning you. Although, there was always the option of wearing the handcuff of the awkward wriststrap they give you.

This is always responsive, and something anyone can dip into. For that reason, bowling is in my opinion the best game in Wii Sports. Next is tennis. This should be amazing but instead, it's just shaking the wiimote at the right time. It doesn't matter how you swing or shake it- the way it aims is due to your timing. Still, this is a great game, though matches are too short, even at the highest settings. There's a baseball game, which responds accurately to how you hold and swing the wiimote. In the same way, when bowling, the controls are fast and responsive. Depending on how you swing, you can put a spin on the ball. Golf and boxing is where it all goes haywire. Golf works how you'd imagine, with the wiimote being the golf club. The controls respond well when hitting the ball long distance. But when you're close to the hole, on the fairway, the wii remote's sensing can't pick up gentle hits. So you're forced to hit the ball harder, and then it zips over the hole. Golf is more frustrating than it is fun. Boxing, meanwhile, responds accurately- just a second after you do something. This lag stops it from being enjoyable. As well as these sports, there are training minigames for each of them, which adds to the fun, plus improves your skill. There is also a fitness test which is useless as it tells you nothing about your fitness. The better you become at sports, the higher your 'level' becomes. At 1000, you become 'pro level'. And that's far from easy to do. Wii Sports is the first game to get for your wii simply because it showcases what that remote can do. But bad boxing and golf bring it down.… Expand",

Controls work pretty well, however, the spin controls work properly at a precentage of 49%. Sometimes when you release the ball by swinging and twisting at the same time with your remote as you release B, your ball will either go slow and go on the side or twist slowly no matter how you twist your remote. Golf was OK. The courses looked pretty nice, but the controls  When you swing your remote slowly as if you were putting, you can't hit the ball. You have to swing it a little more fast enough so the ball can land at a distance you want it to be at. And Boxing was a Hit. Controls work pretty well.

                "Then there is the Wii Wheel peripheral itself, which if you did not already know is just a plastic housing for the Wiimote. I have to admit though it is a well made bit of plastic, and is not only smarter looking than the uninspired Wii Zapper, but also more ergonomic to hold. Unexpectedly it is very easy to use.",

                "We're treated to the same formula as we got the last time, with the major addition being the online mode. It’s not much, but since Mario Kart is all about playing together it's enough to make this an entertaining package.", 
                "One thing Mario Kart Wii features a lot of is multiplayer options.",

                "Mario Kart Wii is a great new game in the series. It still plays like a dream and is perhaps the most enjoyable game of the last few years. Even the additions of motorcycles, Wii-Wheel and online mode are suprisingly good. Mario Kart Wii even does something which most other games lack: It brings fun.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii doesn't stray far from the beaten track, but it has enough going to dazzle first-time MK drivers and a few new upgrades to challenge the long-time Karters, too.", 
                "Newcomers will find a fast-paced, easy-to-play title that relishes in its own ability to capitalize on the wacky approachability and fun of Nintendo’s mascot characters.", 
                "The overuse of power-ups is blatantly ridiculous and the general design hasn't changed much, but Kart is still a riotous romp.",

                "Between the local and online multiplayer, as well as the plethora of single-player challenges available, this is the kind of game that has a ton of replay value. No, it’s not an overhaul, but it is an extremely solid entry in the series that lives up to the Mario Kart name.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii features an impressive online experience, but falls a bit short in the offline content.",

                "After all the hype surrounding this game (or lack thereof), Mario Kart Wii is the same game we've been playing over and over again for years now, which either has you jumping up and down with glee or shaking your head in disgust.",

                "In spite of a few valid criticisms, Mario Kart Wii is a ton of fun, albeit being the same experience as always wrapped in a different package.", 
                "At sixteen years young, Mario Kart has now made it to the Wii. Whilst fans of the series may lament some of the changes, it generally works well on the new platform. The focus has shifted away from a heavy skill requirement towards simply offering more entertainment.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is exactly what you would expect from this franchise, a solid offer that doesn't offer anything new, yet still manages to retain its appeal. Especially if you manage to get a few friends together to play it or decide to give use to its solid online capabilities.", 
                "Ultimately, the sheer sensory pleasure of playing Mario Kart Wii - from the charming animations, to the bopping tunes, to the sugar-rush boosting, to the exquisite steering - far overcomes the few concerns we have about it. It still has to be docked a mark for the awkward structure and compromised multiplayer modes - but it's still unreservedly recommended to anyone for whom Mario Kart is a gaming cornerstone.", 
                "While Mario Kart Wii is an enjoyable sequel we can't help but be a little disappointed that the same level of effort Nintendo put into Mario Galaxy and Smash Bros. isn't mirrored here.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii feels recycled and simplified from past installments, but it's saved by a handful of creative and nostalgaic courses and it's excellent 12-player online matches.", 
                "Mario Kart Wii is fairly fun, although I do have to wonder how much play it will get in single-player mode. In multiplayer, you just have a blast with your friends.", 
                "In the end, Mario Kart Wii aims for a high level of fun and depending on how new you are to the franchise; it actually manages to do that.  There's plenty of room for improvement though.", 
                "At its core,  Mario Kart Wii is a simple, accessible title that lends itself to fun-filled evenings with friends on the couch or online games with racers halfway around the world.", 
                "With Mario Kart being the epitome of racing franchises for many years, it is sad to see how little the game changes its dry formula and actually takes several leisurely steps at addressing failing issues.", 
                "For anyone who has their Wii up and running online, you should definitely take the plunge, because the game's strengths will outweigh its flaws. If you can only play this game offline, however, then unless you're a masochist (or someone psychotic like me, who actually managed to get to the final stage of F-Zero GX’s crazy-hard Story Mode) pass on this; in fact, I'd go so far as to advise you to run in the other direction.", 
                "While Mario Kart Wii is predictably similar to its predecessors, something has changed with this installment. Something that makes it feel subtly unlike other Mario Karts--and not a change for the better. [June 2008, p.73]", 
                "Having sacrificed racing integrity in \"Double Dash\" to side with social silliness, Nintendo has turned 180 degrees into an awkward halfway house. [May 2008, p.86]", 
                "It might seem like the most complete Mario Kart experience yet, but in reaching for a wider audience, Nintendo may have lost sight of what made the series great in the first place. [May 2008, p.112]", 
                "[Mario Kart Wii's Battle Mode] is no longer a last-man-standing contest: Matches now last three minutes each, and if your kart takes too much damage, don't worry! You'll just respawn. Even worse, all battles are now played in teams of two. So while you can still have four human players, they can't all face off against each other -- and what's the point of that?",

            "description": "Mario Kart Wii comes with the intuitive Wii Wheel, which makes it easy for novices to compete against veterans, so no one is left in the dust. And with a broadband hookup to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, players can compete with up to 11 other drivers from around the world for racing dominance. The game includes 16 new courses and 16 classic courses from previous Mario Kart games. For the first time ever, players have the option of racing with either karts or motorbikes. Players can also hit the road as their personalized Mii caricatures in addition to the handful of classic Nintendo characters found in the game. True to the series, the game features tons of racing, plenty of power-ups and oodles of objects for players to use to slow down other drivers. And 10 battle arenas keep players busy between trips around the circuit. Mario Kart Wii supports four different control options: Wii Remote with or without the Wii Wheel, Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller combo, Classic Controller and even the Nintendo GameCube controller. So there's bound to be a configuration that fits everyone's style. Mario Kart Wii launches with a new channel added to the Wii Menu to enhance game play: The Mario Kart Wii Channel. This new channel builds on the online community of Wii owners and lets players compete in tournaments, check worldwide rankings, see when their friends are playing and download ghost data.

For every 10 games played online, I would estimate you will encounter at LEAST 3 or 4 games with such cheaters.

Single player is a great challenge, and people who complain about being taken out by items obviously haven't been paying attention - that's what Mario Kart is all about! Besides, if you're good enough you can avoid them (ie don't stay in the middle of the road, you know that's where Bullet Bill travels). Online is where the game really shows off: it's completely lag free and there's nearly always a maximum 11 opponents to race against. You will quite easily race 50 times in a row without realising how much time you've spent online in this game - it's just so damn addicting and fun.

Its the latest iteration in the Mario Kart series, and it is a good game. But it isn't a great one, and its flaws rankle. First off, unlike its predecessors, you have to actually unlock the right to play every race. This sucks, because it is annoying not to be able to just jump in wherever. But the bigger issue here is that playing multiplayer -doesn't unlock the races-. So you get the game, plug it in to play with your friends (and you can now play with up to FOUR people vs the computers in the grand-prix type race) and... you can't play any but the first four cups without beating all the cups in single player. This is incredibly frustrating and there's absolutely no good reason for this. The races shouldn't be locked in the first place, and even if they had to be for some reason, there's absolutely no reason whatsoever multiplayer play shouldn't be able to unlock them. Battle Modes are, likewise, inferior; you can no longer do free-for-alls between four players, which were the most fun, and you can't do elimination battle matches anymore, which were also fun - why isn't this still an option, at least? There's no good reason for it. The computers also are very poor at battle mode. The items in this game also suffer from being too swingy. Blue shells are too difficult to avoid and Bullet Bills are just horribly overpowered and completely game-swinging, and frustrating when you're doing well and then suddenly a bullet bill comes up and beats you. Overall the game is a good game - its got good races (though I feel Mario Kart 64 had better courses on the whole) and it is a fun racing game, but there have been better racing games. If you play it alone, you'll probably like it quite a bit, but multiplayer just feels like second fiddle, and as I purchased it for the sole purpose of playing grand prix mode multiplayer, its quite annoying. That said, the time trials are quite cool in this game, as you race against \"ghosts\" which are previous racers. While this existed previously, you can now download and race against other players as well as the \"staff ghosts\", which makes it more enjoyable as you can sort of tell how well you're doing. Overall, thumbs up, but not the greatest game ever, let alone the greatest mario kart game ever. Incidentally, the Wii wheel is pretty awkward - you're better off using the controller.… Expand",

The removal of dual-player karts is also a step down from Double Dash, but the inclusion of tracks from SNES, GBA, N64, and GameCube are a welcome addition. Getting a 3-star overall rating is essentially impossible, so it's honestly baffling why they included it. Even two stars on 150cc tracks requires constantly restarting the 4-race circuit, and a constant stream of blue shells along with the unforgiving and cheap AI will result in controllers broken in frustration. Players going for high scores needn't bother using the overly sensitive and fairly useless motion control feature. Despite the numerous downsides, Nintendo managed to put in a fairly respectable effort that's a lot of fun (in short bursts at least) for gamers of all ages.… Expand",

(Although after playing for a while you start to realize that it should be called Mario Bike, because there isn't much point to using the karts after realizing how much better the bikes are.)\r-Some of the new levels are really fun to play.\r Now for the negatives\r-Grand Prix is a huge let down.  After realizing that the wheel contoller syley is a hinderance instead of a help, and switching to the controller/numchuck configuration, 50cc is way too easy.  The rubber band AI in 150cc is so over the top that it's not really worth playing 150cc cups unless you want to unlock characters/carts/bikes/mirror mode.  100cc came close to being fun, but didn't quite balance out right.\r-The reliance of over-powered items (espically in 150cc) rather than making the AI better racers.\r-The wheel controller style is very inaccurate and annoying to use.\r-Battle mode isn't worth playing\r-No 2 player Grand Prix\r-This is way too much of a luck game.  I could understand having multiplayer purely casual (or as I would like to have seen, a way to change the setting between casual and hardcore style gaming) but making the solo player grand prix mode the way it is makes no sense to me.  The overpowered items, the terrible rubber band AI, the addition of 4 more racers to throw things at you, the fact that 9 times out of 10 all 12 racers finish the race within 3-5 seconds of each other so when you get hit with 3 red shells, 2 blue shells, and a pow block right at the end, you go from 1st to 11th, and just the simple fact that you can't go a tenth of a lap without getting hit with something make it very unenjoyable to play.\r-Overall the game felt lazy too me.  It seems as though they relied on the gimick of the wheel controller and the new items to sell the game, and in the process got very sloppy with the actual gameplay.\r So overall, I feel that this game had tons of potential, but unfortunatly a lot of it was wasted.

But, beneath the vibrant environments that Mario Kart has to offer, the experience as a whole is both short and shallow. Each track loses its spark after a race or two and there is just no reason to keep playing the campaign unless you are a completionist who needs to have every trophy in his possession. There is no clear advantage or disadvantage to any one racer, feeling like a wasted opportunity. In addition, no customization or skill points for one's Miis is a considerable letdown. But Mario Kart's worst offense is its perpetual frustration in regards to enemy AI. This game is one of those few titles that a player can deem \"cruelly unfair.\" Once you go deeper into the game, the competitions no longer depend on skill or driving ability but how lucky you are in regards to the number of blue shells blowing up in your face. The last race I played before discarding Mario Kart for a long time had me in first place mere feet from the finish line. A string of three shells fired at me in rapid succession dropped me from a first place victory to a 10th place embarrassment, and serves as a lasting reminder of my experience with the game.

The most annoying thing about Mario Kart Wii, by far, are the babyish/childish voices. Good lord, they are annoying. Not only are they excessive, high-pitched, and embarrassing, they are not natural in the least bit. Just about the only characters who have remained true to what they're supposed to sound like are Mario, Luigi, and Koopa Troopa, with Peach and Bowser being \"acceptable\". All the other characters, including Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Toad, etc sound odd and very childish. Why couldn't Nintendo included an option to turn off voice SFX and/or music like the previous Mario Karts? As for control, it can be somewhat difficult at times, as others have stated, but I believe with enough time spent in front of the TV, you'll eventually figure it out. The graphics are not as bad as many make it out to be - this is, after all, Nintendo. The items are fairly fun to use but can become very excessive - which leads me to my next point... The A.I., as others have stated before me, can be very unfair in the sense that you will be punished whether you are winning or not. This can happen via a blue shell as you're approaching the finish line in lap 3, or the fact that if ou lag behind far enough, pretty much no power-up (or series of power-ups) will save you.

For instance, getting hit by red shells non-stop, and those damn flying shells that hit you when you're in first place. Also, the favouritsm with the items is appaulling, if you're doing well (ie. the top three..) then you get horrible items like bananas and green shells. When you're in last, you get awesome items. It just isn't fair. -The Music: I remember when each Mario Kart level used to have distinct music that I would love to hear when I was playing the game. (Rainbow Road, anyone?) But it all seems a bit lost in translation here. Instead, we get o hear characters make annoying noises, such as \"WHOO HOO!\" and \"Yeahhhhhh!\" It's just plain irritating, and makes gameplay all the more difficult. And last, but not least, my last complaint is that the game seems to rely too much on a gimmick (the steering with the Wiimote) and, in turn the levels are just not that fun.

You might find sports packages that offer up a more in-depth gameplay experience for an individual sport , but you'd be hard pressed to find a package with more variety and fun than the one found in Wii Sports Resort.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is truly an experience like no other, offering truly real sports experiences and incredibly fun multiplayer modes.", 
                "The fun and charm from the original is back and the improved controls don’t ruin from the experience at all that is to be had with the 12 categories of minigames.  In fact, if there’s anything to complain about with the game’s depth, it’s probably the possibility that it might be too much to swallow.", 
                "With 12 sporting games included in Wii Resort, there's definitely something for everyone and although the game will eventually get quite boring in single-player, where this game does shine besides it's party-game atmosphere is through the new Wii MotionPlus attachment that takes Wii gaming to its next evolution.", 
                "A game that delivers entertainment in massive, unbridled waves. It’s true that Resort doesn’t quite strike the balance between single-player and party appeal, but its compulsive score-based structure is a significant step up from its predecessor.", 
                "Just as Wii Sports was exactly what Nintendo needed to help shift units when the Wii launched so too Wii Sports Resort proves to be a perfect advert for MotionPlus as well as still being a cracking game in its own right.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort discovers the real power of the Wii Motion Plus in a game that shows the power and talent of Nintendo when creating funny and incredibly addictive gaming experiences. If you liked Wii Sports, you will adore this title.", 
                "Arguably this is the best Wii party game ever. It's also a great Motion Plus demonstration. [Sept 2009, p.72]", 
                "As far as mini-game collections go on the Wii, this is undoubtedly the cream of the crop. You'll be surprised how much fun you have with some events, and how little you garner from others, but there are still some rock solid experiences that you'll come back to again and again when friends and family gather.", 
                "With its broad appeal and simple, intuitive controls, Wii Sports Resort will have everyone up off the couch having fun… Wii guarantee you’ll love it.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort expands upon the enjoyment and accessibility of it’s predecessor in nearly every aspect.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort  is proof of the full maturity of the Wii’s control system. Thanks to the Wii Motion Plus you can really do something unbeliveable in the past. Wii Sports Resort is a great title, which captures immediately casual and harddcore gamer. Unlike its predecessor, offers an high-level single player and you can play it for days. We don’t emphasize how much fun can give playing it in two or more people: it’s an experience that can make you laugh for hours and hours. Resort is undoubtedly Nintendo’s second great evolution.", 
                "Wii Sport Resort overtakes its predecessor in quality and quantity, resulting in a complete game experience.", 
                "For fans of Wii Sports, there’s no reason not to pick up Wii Sports Resort. It comes bundled with the Wii MotionPlus, contains several addictive offerings, and should provide some variety at your parents next Wii Sports party.", 
                "Nothing can match the joy found in simply picking up a controller and hitting the beach. [Sept 2009, p.88]", 
                "It'll remind you why you picked up the console in the first place and, more than likely, spark a renaissance of Wii parties.", 
                "It's another easy-to-learn, fun-to-play, great-with-the-family game, with realistic and satisfying motion controls to boot.", 
                "Buying three extra peripherals and playing with others WILL make you happier... you won't want to take the trip alone. [Sept 2009, p.56]", 
                "The latest Wii Sports makes the original seem lacking in every department. With plenty of new gameplay modes, the inclusion of WMP and a bunch of new additions, 'Resort' is set to be one of the most important videogames of this summer. It's a shame that there's no online features, but still it has everything of what it takes to become a blockbuster in no time.", 
                "Ultimately, Wii Sports Resort is the concept of the first entry, but taken much further, in part thanks to the Wii Motion Plus, but also for Nintendo's will to make Wii Sports a more complete game, able to satisfy both veterans and newcomers.", 
                "More accessible and way more interesting than its predecessor, Wii Sports Resort isn’t only the best compilation of mini-games to be offered on the Wii console in a while but also a great way to display what the Wii Motion Plus accessory can do. However, keep in mind that the real fun of Wii Sports Resort will come out when you play in groups. If you like playing solo, this might not be the best game for you.", 
                "Given the price of admission, which includes the game and one MotionPlus controller, I’d say that you can’t go wrong picking up this title as it should keep you and your friends busy for quite some time.", 
                "Not all of the sports are winners and having a house full of people is still the best way to get the most enjoyment out of the game, but even with these slight caveats, it's hard not to recommend Wii Sports Resort to gamers of all ages and experience levels.", 
                "While not every event in the game is going to please you, I'm sure you'll find plenty of things to like, especially with a group of friends.", 
                "Wii Sports was a must for Wii owners, as anyone could pick up and play those games. Wii Sports Resort is also very fun to play with people, and it's an added experience with new games, more precise controls, and good ol' Wii Bowling and Golf.", 
                "But even without that crucial feature, Wii Sports Resort still feels like an accomplishment, not only because it offers a fun and accessible experience built around the MotionPlus attachment, but because it may very well renew optimism in those jaded by the lackluster motion controls seen over the last couple years.", 
                "With more than double the games and a new level of accuracy, Wii Sports Resort was worth the wait.", 
                "If Wii Sports was the Pong of our day, Wii Sports Resort is the Super Pong machine with color graphics and handball and hockey modes: Some of it is superfluous, but it’s worth the upgrade.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is more then a fun collection of sports, which are great to play together. Baseball, swordfight and table tennis are great games, but jet ski is less fun. Wii Motionplus is a great addition, and the game will last for hours if you play it together with friends. Are you a single player type of gamer? Then the game will get boring over time!", 
                "There's plenty here to do alone, but as with the original Wii Sports, Resort is far better when played with a friend.", 
                "I was lucky enough to review the game while my in-laws, who are not gamers, were visiting. We played every night, and they loved it. Nintendo is trying to reach the non-gamer audience, and Wii Sports Resort is just the prescription.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort manages to make us forget about controllers, displays and reality, and makes us play like kids, sensing that we really shot that arrow and we really took down those ten pins at bowling.", 
                "Yes, it may well be a tech demonstration of MotionPlus, but on the upside somebody built a game around it for us to have some fun with, and to experience how much WMP really does improve on the original controls.", 
                "Wii MotionPlus doesn't disappoint. The tiny, $20 peripheral (you get one free with the game; the rest are sold separately) is everything it's cracked up to be - when placed in the hands of developers who know what they're doing.", 
                "The addition of MotionPlus makes Wii Sports Resort more intuitive to play and adds lastability to gameplay. Controls aside, presentation and quantity of content has also been improved. [Sept 2009, p.108]", 
                "A glimpse into the promising future of what developers can do with the power of the MotionPlus. If you can, for just a moment, get past the fact that the console's motion controls were not 1:1 to begin with and not let that sour the experience, you will get a lot out of it.", 
                "This is hands down the best party experience on any home console, one that you will want to pick up as soon as you get a chance.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort serves as more than just a tech demo for WiiMotionPlus, and more than just a collection of minigames. It does well as a proper sequel to Wii Sports, being easy to pick up and fun to play alone or with friends. There is far more below the surface than meets the eye in this title that is far more hit than miss.", 
                "Resort demonstrates the MotionPlus upgrade perfectly and thus offers a decent multiplayer experience.", 
                "Although Wii Sports Resort looks simple, it uses the new Wii MotionPlus technology surprisingly well. Apart from the technological improvements the game contains twelve extensive sports that provides lots of entertainment when playing with company.", 
                "If you’re like me, where Wii Sports continues to get the most play on your Wii, then you’re surely itching to get your hands on Wii Sports Resort, if you haven’t done so already.", 
                "By buying Wii Sports Resort you get a game we recommend. The inferior graphics will be compensated by the beautiful sound and great gameplay. The only thing that should be stopping you from purchasing this game is the rare possibility that you have no-friends to play it with at all!", 
                "A great display of how motion-controlled gaming can work. Bigger and better than Wii Sports too.", 
                "A wide variety of games and accessible-yet-deep controls make Wii Sports Resort a must-have party game.", 
                "At the very least it’s a wonderful demonstration of the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus peripheral, and shows just how much it changes Wii motion sensing for the better. The device is incredibly accurate and Wii Sports Resort shows this extremely well in several games that are really fun – if just slightly shallow – sports-based diversions.", 
                "All in all, families that loved the first one would be well advised to pick up the sequel. It’s a better game, and for the price of admission you get an accessory that will (hopefully) allow for improved gameplay for the future.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort perhaps doesn't go as far as a good sequel should, but it's still - yes, yes - damned good fun.", 
                "A fun but shallow mini-game collection, whose hobbled simulations still make good use of the MotionPlus.", 
                "I strongly suspect people will pick up Wii Sports Resort on name recognition alone, and be mystified by the odd white attachment inside. If enough WMPs are sold, and enough developers pay attention, it may just work.", 
                "The Wii Sports along this becomes almost a demo. The number of modes and games available is great. It is spectacular to put the capabilities of the Wii Motion Plus in test and improve the control of movements of the Wii, given that we have a fun game here.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is a fantastic showpiece for MotionPlus, and the one thing that Gamestyle takes away from its time with the game is the possibility of what it could lead to.", 
                "Set of minigames takes full advantage of the enhanced abilities you get with the new Motion Plus controller. Graphics are still a bit lame but a wide range of sports and accessibility will satisfy every kind of casual gamer. [Sept 2009]", 
                "Motion Plus tech demo lacks the depth of the real game. Non-gamers loves this though, and you can have a lot of fun with it, if your friends are stupid, drunk or both. [July 2009]", 
                "With two or more players, the sequel is, once again, a compulsive riot. Played alone, however, some of its pieces seem sweet, but a little empty.", 
                "Most of the mini-games are surprisingly skill-based, and even Wii Sports haters should find something to enjoy. I definitely did.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort fits into the rotation of party games, but it has the breezy weakness of being lost in the shuffle.", 
                "For Wii Sports diehards, Wii Sports Resort will be worth a look, but for the rest of us – especially those who’ve thrashed Bowling to death already, this is a patchy offering more notable for its missed opportunities than its successes.", 
                "Wii Sports Resort is a mixed bag when it comes to value for money. If you already own a number of Wiimotes this will give you a really entertaining experience with friends and family. Most of the new minigames are really entertaining and the revamped ones have been greatly improved. The Wii Motion Plus does improve the overall feeling a lot, but since it remedies past shortcomings that's more of a necessity than a strength. As a whole this is definitely not entertaining enough to warrant multiple purchases to get the Wii Motion Plus but if you already own the controls you'll find a lot to like here.", 
                "Sports Resort is controlling, and even solemn, about just how much fun you should be having with it. And that’s a development that should chill every Wii owner to the bone."

This sequel to the popular Wii Sports makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory, which gives players the most responsive and realistic experience possible. The Wii MotionPlus accessory, which is included with Wii Sports Resort, plugs into the base of the Wii Remote controller and, combined with the accelerometer and sensor bar, provides an experience that gives players an even greater sense of immersion. Just as with Wii Sports, people compete against friends and family. As the competition heats up, Wii Sports Resort is as much fun to watch as it is to play. First-time players should find it easy to pick up a Wii Remote and jump into the action. Wii Sports Resort takes place on a tropical island. A wide range of activities keep players coming back for one more round. Some sample activities include Sword Play, Power Cruising (racing a water scooter) and Disc Dog, which involves accurately tossing a disc to a cute, Mii-like dog. [Nintendo]",

Sure, it was fun, but not exactly amazing.\rWii Sports Resort not only improves gameplay with the addition of motionplus, which is an add-on that improves motion-sensing, but has more and better minigames. I won't go through every one, but generally, Wii Sports Resort was great fun. It takes place on an idylic island setting, with beaches, ocean, sand, znd a volcano in the background. Wii Sports Resort didn't need a setting, so this is a nice touch.\rSome of the best minigames take place on the water- wakeboarding, which uses the motion sensing of the wii remote, is maybe my favourite. Another favourite is power cruising, which has you race through arches as fast as possible.\rThere's also cycling, which is especially fun in multiplayer. Another great minigame lets you freely explore the island resort... on a plane. In this minigame, you can fly over places, dive down a crater, and do so much more.\rArchery is another excellent game, one of the best. Of the twelve sports, though, there are a  few stinkers. Golf in the original wii sports was bad because half the time, it couldn't sense the motion properly. It returns in sport resort, and you'd think motionplus would improve it, but no. The sensing is just as bad.\rAnother stinker is bowling, again copied from wii sports. But unlike wii sports, the ball moves erratically however you flick the remote. Weird that it's actually worse with motionplus.\rBut overall, sports resort is a great minigame collection, and uses the wii remote in a variety of different ways. There's no online, which is a shame, but multiplayer is a complete blast. It's one of the most addictive experiences on the wii. Sadly, single player is greatly lacking, so if you for whatever reason can only play on your own, I suggest you give this a miss. But with friends, it's the ultimate party game.… Expand",

It's simple, it's fun, and it's everything I'd want from a sport included in this package. Score: 10/10\r Wakeboarding may get old fast for some but it definitely didn't for me! I love going on the sea and doing all sorts of cool tricks to earn points. It always read my motions perfectly so I never felt cheated out of not doing a certain trick right. Score: 9/10\r Frisbee is a bit tough but it's really fun once you get the hang of it. You have to throw a frisbee into a certain area so a dog can catch it. The more on target you are with the area, the more points you'll earn. There's also a Golf Frisbee mode in which the dog isn't there and you're throwing a frisbee on a golf course but I prefer dog frisbee.

Wii Sports Resort has revealed with its MotionPlus technology that my bowling ball throwing isn't as good as I thought it was. Still, bowling is super enjoyable and I love it! The 100-pin bowling is a nice twist that's also pretty fun. Score: 10/10\r Power Cruising: Um...no comment.

Score: 4/10\r Cycling: Finally, another great sport! Cycling is a combination of getting a workout and making your brain work. You have to think about how fast to go and when to stop because if you go too fast, then your Mii will start tiring out.

They definitely need to make a Pilotwings Wii U now or at least an island flyover separate game. It's my favorite in the collection. Skydiving is also amazing. You have to link up with other skydivers to get more points. Dogfighting's the only sport that has to be done with two players but it's also enjoyable.

                "What you get here defines what Nintendo is all about - simple but brilliant gameplay that keeps you hooked from start to finish.", 
                "NSMB manages to blend elements from the past seamlessly with gameplay technologies of today. Familiar enemies, powerups and levels all mesh with new elements to form what is the best Mario game to date.",

                "Before New Super Mario Bros. entered my life, \"Yoshi's Island\" was, to me, the greatest platformer ever created. That title may now have to go to New Super Mario Bros.", 
                "In the very opening, when Bowser surreptitously swipes the Princess, any Mario fan will smile in newfound satisfaction, ready to re-live, perhaps for the first time since that first time, what it's like to play a gem of a Nintendo game. [Jun 2006, p.52]", 
                "But it, love it, and pray to the gods that we don't have to wait another 10 years for Mario's next side-scrolling masterpiece. [July 2006, p.93]", 
                "The game manages to recreate the awesomeness of past titles while making sure it feels like a new game.", 
                "While some may argue that it’s too short or lacks difficulty, I definitely have to disagree. I had my fair share of deaths and the replay value is heightened significantly if you collect the myriad of coins disseminated throughout the game.", 
                "This is the hot game to get for the DS. It's loads of fun, has huge exploration potential and reinvents the 2D side-scrolling platform game. Nintendo has another notch on it's belt to go with all the other notches that the DS seems to have.", 
                "It might not be the huge revolution some hoped it would be, but this is a highly enjoyable and well-crafted trip down memory lane. [July 2006, p.112]", 
                "An excellent game and one that you should seriously consider purchasing if only for the sheer amount of fun.", 
                "Never slowing down, never faltering: New Super Mario Bros. redoes the past with new action and some new surprises, once more in retro-materialized gold. Whether you're from the old school or a student of the new school, you're going to love New Super Mario Bros. no matter what.", 
                "New sets out to simply give gamers more of what they want--more enemies, more levels, more bosses, more high-quality Mario. One can almost hear the trumpets as the classic platformer makes its triumphant return.", 
                "You've gotta give it up to Nintendo for bundling a  phenomenal suite of over 25 Wi-Fi multiplayer minigames with the single-player game. [July 2006, p.96]", 
                "While it lasts, it’s some of the best platforming to date and features what I consider to be the best Nintendo DS graphics to date. While it’s a shame the new power-ups are frills and the length of the main game is ridiculously short, it’s hard not to recommend it.", 
                "It's still an unparalleled platformer that should make your eyes light up, then glaze over in obsessive concentration.", 
                "What the game does right is take advantage of the updated graphical capabilities of the DS in order to help move the 2D Mario franchise further, and it does it well propelling this game to the status of one of the most fun of its types on the system.", 
                "The kind of game that makes hardcore Nintendo fans get on their knees and weep in sheer joy over the eighty new levels of new 2D Mario action...The visuals come in scorching hot, with gorgeous 3D bringing the old school into a new school setting. Sprinkle in some minigames and multiplayer modes, and you have a system seller.", 
                "The new additions -- in particular the power-ups -- struggle to justify their inclusion, but they also keep the game from feeling like too much of a retread. It's unlikely that anyone will put this at the top of his or her list of favorite Mario games.", 
                "New Super Mario Bros. (NSMB) features the best wall jump yet—there is precious little more satisfying than saving oneself from a perilous pit with a knee-jerk wall-jump. Mario may not control as he did in any of the classic Mario games, but he still feels perfect.", 
                "While I still hold \"Super Mario World\" as the best 2D Mario game, with \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" as the runner up, New Super Mario hits a close third. But it does have much more replay value than the other two, as you could easily play this one a few times though without the risk of it getting stale.", 
                "While experienced players might blow through the game quickly, New Super Mario Bros. is still completely awesome and absolutely necessary.", 
                "You're getting a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super-quick stylus games - that's real value.", 
                "The graphics are simply stunning, as is the soundtrack (though not in a good way).", 
                "And I've done this sort of thing before hundreds of times across thousands of days in what feels like a dozen Mario games. I still love it.", 
                "It proves that a simple style that we once loved and cherished can still be pulled off in today’s world of flashy visuals and 80-hour game time. The level design is fantastic, the music is nostalgic and the sheer joy I get while playing this game is indescribable.", 
                "It has everything you want from a platforming Mario Bros. game and then some.", 
                "Simply the best platformer to be released on any handheld.", 
                "The bottom line is you must own this. It’s your duty as a DS owner.", 
                "It's a finely-crafted slice of the Mario as you know and love it, with so many extra superb bells and whistles, it'd still scare the pants of the hard-of-hearing. If that's not recommendation enough, then we don't know what is.", 
                "New Super Mario Bros. treads the retro platformer line beautifully, adding just enough originality and imagination to the mix.", 
                "Old-fashioned Mario fun. As pleasurable, challenging and addictive as two decades ago.", 
                "The ingenuity of design, the sheer level of fun, the warmth of nostalgia and the relief that 2D gaming is still alive and kicking, all combine to make NSMB an unmissable experience and show Nintendo are still masters of the platform game.", 
                "A modern classic, but one that is perhaps overly familiar at times. [Aug 2006, p.58]", 
                "One of the best platform outings in all of gaming, an instant classic when it first appeared, which even with some newness thrown in remains almost perfect today.", 
                "Old school 2D works just as well as it did 15 years ago. The difficulty level is set too low, but even if you rush through the game, there is still loads to explore afterwards. [Aug 2006, p.50]", 
                "Nintendo has really captured the essence and features of what makes the series so popular and why it is one of the most revered and well recognized game series ever made.", 
                "Seriously, stop reading this dripping review and just go out and play this game.", 
                "The new moves, power-ups and graphics are just enough to make this game feel original while keeping its roots in the past. Even though New Super Mario Bros. isn't a revolution, it's still a great fun platforming game.", 
                "It’s worth getting a DS, that’s for sure. But if you’re one of those junkies that doesn’t pay full price for a game because it hardly makes use of the system’s “capabilities”, then fine; be that junky.", 
                "The first true 2D Mario game since Super Mario World maintains the high standard set by its legendary predecessors.", 
                "A welcome return to top form for the world's most exhausted videogame hero. [Aug 2006, p.52]", 
                "With a concept as timeless (and downright fun) as the one that the Mario Bros. games adhere to, it would be tough to screw this game up. And Nintendo didn't ... not by a longshot.", 
                "New Super Mario Bros. is a solid platformer and a nice homage to the Mario series, but it's not Mario's big return to 2D gameplay like everyone thought it would be.", 
                "The versus mode breathes some fresh air into his little lungs, but this latest foray has us wondering: can Mario ever truly be new again?", 
                "With summer here there is going to be more gaming on the go as handhelds get taken on road trips. And just in time, Nintendo has given us a blast from the past to take along and relive the fun of our wasted youths. The game mechanics show a bit of their age, but it is still a lot of great, simple fun.", 
                "Nintendo's crafted a thoroughly enjoyable game here, a solid portable experience packed with everything that makes Mario so great -- challenge, fanservice, secrets. Everything except brash imagination.", 
                "Far too many of the NSMB levels are simply too short. Even in the final world, it feels as though you're hitting the midway restart point in seconds, and then crossing the finish line when the level was just hitting its stride.", 
                "Is it as good as \"Yoshi’s Island,\" \"Super Mario World,\" or \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"? No. And that is a disappointing fact. It is, however, a solid game, worth it for the nostalgic trip alone.", 
                "This game should prove fairly easy to those of us who have grown up with previous Mario titles; the levels are incredibly short, the difficulty is fair at best, and the whole thing seems to need a bit more fleshing out.", 
                "In a family whose every member shouts from the rooftops, it risks palling into the background. Set it on its own, though – or besides absolutely any other 2D platformer – and it shines with dazzling kaleidoscopic brightness. [July 2006, p.78]", 
                "New Super Mario Bros. definitely doesn’t live up to the standards set by the games it apes, but there’s still no better sidescroller to be found on the DS.", 
                "It is a fantastic package, no doubt. Despite the single-player’s unfortunate lack of length, and the ease with which many will speed through it, New Super Mario Bros. is everything one could want from a return to 2D Mario. [July 2006, p.118]", 
                "The wall jump from Mario 64 is perhaps the single best introduction to NEW Super Mario Bros.", 
                "Welcome back, Mario. Each day without you was like another dagger through my (S)NES, and your return is triumphant if short-lived.", 
                "New Super Mario Bros might not be QUITE as good as some review sites might lead you to believe, but there is no denying that this is a damn fine game: the game play is there, that familiar Nintendo charm is dominant throughout the entire game, the sounds are good, and it's definitely got personality. The good far outweighs the bad.", 
                "The level of nostalgia is really unsurpassed. However, the quest ends a little too quickly and the lack of flight is a tremendous downer.", 
                "I can talk about why the game is fun, but I can't lie and say the game is brilliant. Mario isn't what he used to be. There are glimmers and flickers of greatness in this game -  moments where I felt the magic might almost be back. But it's not. Not yet.", 
                "It is almost as if half way into production one of the higher ups saw the progress, wasn’t happy and forced them to stick to the old formula that’s more than a decade old. The game is also really short."

After 15 years without a classic 2D Mario game, New Super Mario Bros. marks the return of the king to the 2D platforming genre, with a new fresh look and the same excellent gameplay everbody came to love in the 8-bit and 16-bit era.\r Mario controls as great as he did back in the day. NSMB features 8 different worlds, each with a distinct theme. Nowadays everyone is sick of seeing the same 8 world-themes in 2D Mario games, but this is the game that introduced them, and I think it was a good idea. As for the levels, most of them are really fun and well designed. Each levels holds 3 optional Star Coins, which are the main collectables in this game. Most of them are pretty easy to get though. The whole game is a bit on the easy side, actually. This might bother some of the old-school Mario fans, and it might be the game's biggest flaw. The amount and variety of levels is satisfactory to me. The game is bit short, but I think the overall quality and replay value make up for that\r NSMB introuduced some really cool power-ups. The giant mushroom, the mini mushroom and the blue koopa shell are among my favorite Mario power-ups of all time. They're very fun to use. As for the bosses, all of them are OK, but once again, they are way too easy. The game has also a bunch of multiplayer modes, but I didn't play them very much, so I won't comment about them.\r Visually, the game is colorful and has a good level of polish. It mixes 2D backgrounds with 3D models, and the result looks just fine. The melodies are as catchy and happy as ever. Overall, this is a very lighthearted and happy game, one that will put a smile on your face for the time you are playing.\r Some people criticize this game for being too simplistic and not really innovate in any area, like Super Mario World did in 1990. But the truth is that NSMB is pure 2D Mario greatness, it's a return to the more traditional style of the NES Mario titles, which is just perfect as it is. So whether you are a fan of the series, or platformers in general, you need to give this game a try. I would even say it is the best of the new generation 2D Mario games, despite being the worst technology-wise.\r Score: 9.0… Expand",

And as of now I have collected all the star coins, collectible large coins throughout every level, which was not as hard as you might think once you start collecting them. Enough of the cons already. The game is very fun, and rewarding. If you are an experienced Mario player you will recognize bosses and levels  from previous games. For instance, one of the bosses is straight from Super Mario Sunshine, and one of the early levels has huge similarities to world 2-2 in Super Mario Bros 3.

However, I think the WORST part of this game, was the lack of intersting worlds (you have forest, you have desert, you have ice, and I really can't remember the others, since they must have been a bore) and the very linear progression mario makes through the map (the only deviations are short, and usually lead back to the same path).

The only thing you have to look forward to, are playing a couple of levels you most likely missed, and collecting three coins per stage, which is just tedious and irritating.

I really like sonic games, but there's a huge difference between these two games. Sonic Rush simply gives us about twenty levels of more of the same. Rush is short and has nothing new to it. New super mario bros on the other hand successfully takes us back to the oldschool mario days while simultaniously adding tons of new , obsticles, power ups, and moves to the 2-D mario mix. The game consists of about 80 courses (much more levels than sonic rush) These additions work extrememly well with the oldschool mario world. Mario gets a few moves from super mario 64. You can wall jump, butt stomp, and do triple jumps. These new moves make mario as agile as he's ever been in a 2-D game. Then there's the new power ups. There's the Giant Mushroom power up (which is rare and hard to get) which allows you to grow to ten times your original size and for a short time obliterate the level. The shell power up puts a turtle shell on mario's back, and after a quick run you're bouncing around like a stray turtle shell. This power up is a bit unwieldly but once mastered it can be even more powerful than the classic fireball power up. The mini-shroom power up shrinks mario down to miniscule size allowing you to access different game areas, as well as allowing you to jump higher and walk on water. The bad thing about the mini-shroom is you die in one hit, and you must butt-stomp opponents in order to do damage. Some of the new obsticles are mushrooms that tilt sideways as you walk on them, platforms that toss you up into the air like a helecopter, pipes that shoot you out like a cannon, and puzzlles that require you to wall jump or have one of the new power ups in the game. There's more than one path in the game. You can unlock alternate paths by using star cions (simular to the yoshi coins from Super Mario World).

Although, the game play is similar to previous side-scrolling Mario games; you go through 8 worlds and try to get to the end of each level without dying, there's a few new additions like new power ups and new moves that Mario can perform like the stomp or wall kick. New powerups include the mega mushroom, the mini mushroom and shell suit which can be interestingly used to get to hidden areas to find hidden exits or help you clear a level easier. The bosses are great to fight but a tad too easy with some obvious attack patterns. There's a sense of nostalgia when playing this game because this plays similar to the original Super Mario Bros. and has some of the memorable enemies like the Koopa Troopa's and Goomba's which have been given a graphical make over thanks to the Nintendo's DS's more powerful hardware. Even the simple story is similar to Super Mario Bros. but now Bowser Jr has captured Princess Peach and taken her to his castle. The graphics are very nice and the backgrounds are nicely rendered and despite the game play being a bit too simple, there's a great deal of fun to be had and 8 worlds with different themes to complete. The music is brilliant and some of the composed music are remixes of previous Mario game themes such as the Underground theme in Super Mario Bros. What's annoying is that if you want to find a hidden exit in a level and you need a powerup like the shell suit to break blocks which are in your way or a mini mushroom to squeeze through a pipe, you need to get the power up from either normal game play or one from a toad house. Depending on what power up is added to your reserve inventory, depends if you can headbutt the block that contains a random generating item at the right time (basically its like a slot machine and you have to hit the block to stop it on a random item which then is added to your reserve inventory for use later). Hitting this block at the right time is a bummer so you get the item you need and can lead to you leaving the toads house, coming back in and trying again. Despite this little criticism, all the game play enhancements along with sharp graphics and catchy music, Super Mario Bros. DS is a lovely platformer and basically enhances the original Super Mario Bros., with a few tweaks and showcases it to a new platform and generation.… Expand",

Create your own personal Mii character with the Wii console's built-in Mii Channel and then play as yourself in this compilation of nine simple, fun games like target shooting, table tennis and fishing. Wii Play comes bundled with a free Wii Remote, so a friend can instantly join in the action in any of the included games. You can play at home or save your Mii on your Wii Remote and play with it on a friend's console, or use any of the six ready-made guest characters. Wii Play's nine different games are the perfect introduction to what the Wii Remote can do: Shooting Range - A modern version of the Nintendo classic Duck Hunt. Shoot the targets on the screen simply by aiming your Wii Remote. Find Mii - Can you spot a face in the crowd? Use your Wii Remote to point out the correct Mii characters as quickly as you can. Table Tennis - How long can you ping pong? Use your Wii Remote like a paddle to bat the ball and try to beat the computer or human opponent. Pose Mii - Twist the Wii Remote to rotate the Mii characters and quickly slot them into the correct positions as they fall down the screen. Laser Hockey - Tilt and turn the Wii Remote to bash the puck into the opponent's goal, in this high-speed arcade-style game. Billiards - In this version of Nine Ball, aim the Wii Remote at the screen to line up your shot, then pull back and push forward to strike the ball. Fishing - Move the Wii Remote like a rod: dip the hook in the water, wait for the fish to bite (the controller will rumble) and pull back hard to land it. Charge - Take the bull by the horns! Steer your wild steer by holding the Wii Remote sideways, as if gripping reins, and topple scarecrows to score points. Tanks - Take control of a tank with the Wii Remote; aim the cannon, bounce shells off walls, and blast your opponent to bits. [Nintendo Europe]",

I guess I expected Wii Play to have polished, finished mini-games that I could use to kill 5-10 minutes with a friend. Of the 9 minigames in Wii play, I would say only table tennis and the cow game are even close to as enjoyable as the millions of free flash games you can play for free on the internet. The game feels completely unpolished, unfinished and incomplete. For example, in the Pool game you must keep the Wiimote pointed at the screen while you try to move the wiimote back and forward to move the cue. 9 times out of 10 it fails to do what you expect because the \"Please Point Your Wiimote at the screen\" message comes up. The fishing game is frustrating because every time the other person catches a small fry, the view tilts up and you lose the big fish you almost hooked. There are dozens of things that are not quite right in every game. It feels like the developers said \"Wii need 6 months to do this thing right\" and Nintendo said \"You have until tomorrow\". Basically, if I had paid $40 for this game instead of $50, I would still feel I wasted the couple hours I played this worthless title.

                "A great collection of 9 mini-games, definitely worth the extra $10 with the wii-remote. Albeit, the fishing is a little clunky, the games provide a lot of entertainment when wii play is played in the same way as wii sports (say, an hour max a day); and more fun with friends.", 
                "I really would recommend this game. Ok its no Zelda, but its not trying to be. Its a great fun set of mini games which are great value with he remote as well. Get some mates round and have some beers and have a laugh.",

I still don't really know how to play that... but other than that all the other 8 games are amazing :)",

It's also annoying to see Yoshi not being used that much. You won't see him in much more than one or two levels per world if you're lucky. However, the boss fights are brilliant. I love battling Koopa Kids, and the final Bowser boss fight has to be up their with the best boss fights in a Mario platformer. It also has good graphics for a Wii game, and multiplayer is a good laugh with your mates, expect havoc to break loose then. The controls, in my opinon, were a brilliant fit and worked really well in my experience. Overall, a good Mario adventure and a game you must own on the Wii, even if it isn't the finest of Mario's adventures.… Expand",

Even if you play this single player, it is a worthy entry in the Mario series.The bulk of the fun comes from multiplayer.  While it can be frustrating at times, especially with newer players, the fun factor increases as people become more comfortable with the game.  In a nutshell, it's a traditional 2D Mario game with multiplayer but you don't have to take turns.  It's a fantastic experience.So why not a 10?  The difficulty.  I don't mind difficult games.  I have fun with easy games as well.  The problem with this Mario game is the first 8 worlds are relatively on the easy side.  The difficulty goes up progressively as you move from world to world but it is still manageable.  The problem I have is when you successfully collect all of the star coins from Worlds 1-8.  After you accomplish this, a special World 9 opens.  The difficulty in World 9 almost gets to the point of not wanting to finish the game.  It can get extremely frustrating.  Again, I don't mind difficulty in games but I was completely unprepared for World 9.  If you want to finish the game (and I did), be prepared to be patient and be almost perfect to complete this World.Other than this one minor gripe, I recommend this game for everyone!… Expand",

The most recent edition to the Mario kart series isThe story behind it\rMario kart is a racing game that was first launched on the super Nintendo entertainment system in 1962 which was known as Mario kart 64 and is also available via Google play store as well, to date there has been four Mario karts games for home consoles (ds and wii), three for portable games and 2 Namco arcade games. The most recent edition to the Mario kart series is Mario kart 7 which was released onto 3DS sometime last year, there are two more games in the Mario kart series in development which ach are one for the new wii u system and another arcade edition which could hit the shops any time now. The Mario kart games have developed so much over time and the producer has bought in many new things and changed the content every time this has included new items, new characters and many more as well as new tracks different elements, this was to keep the game play fresh and so people who bought all of them weren’t getting the same thing every time so if u has all of them you are never getting the same game on each edition because new content is always added. The one on the ds was probably one of the best racing games ive ever played. Each series contained at least 16 original courses and plus different versions of current tracks E.G. Rainbow road was included in the 16 but then rainbow road 2 was a sequel and not included in the 16 because this was one of the tracks that was released at a later date.\r Suitability\rThe game is suitable for all ages as there is absolutely no violence involved and everyone can play it as it’s a family game which everyone one can play, it is quite addictive because you never know what is going to happen as there is many different tracks which contain many different obstacles so this game isn’t something you can really practice as there is so much content and so many obstacles involved within it. It doesn’t affect your social impacts because it is actually good because you are getting exercise whether you are playing it on Wii or DS. Why it is a good game\rIt was a very good game as there is so much game play and technical ability involved within and is never boring because you never know what is going to happen. The game also tests how quick you are at reacting for example when the obstacles such as rocks are rolling down the track you have to react quickly in order to dodge them as if you get hit if you have any items these will be lost and also any coins that were collected along the track a 1/3 of them will be lost (Mario kart 7 only)I love the technical ability of this game and has got better and better every time a new one is released because this game is no ordinary racing game and is never boring because of all the different items and the different effects that the game unleashes in the middle of the laps, my personal favourite track is rainbow road because I love the colours as is a quick reaction track because the track has a very tight specific area you have to stick too and the layout of the track is consistent so this is also hard where as the others there is side bits that you can use instead of the normal section of the track to try and get more items and to try and get a head start on everyone else but rainbow road doesn’t and is just straight track from start to finish and also contains loops to try and distract you to try and make you fall off, the other reason is it’s a good game is because it enables you to race against other people all over the world using the built in wireless connection system which adds alot of excitement and pressure into the game which is another reason why this is probably why this is one of the best racing games around and will probably only get better when the new editions have finished development and are launched, I personally cannot wait.… Expand",

There's even a series of missions to complete, including a bunch of boss fights. What else can you ask from a Mario Kart game?\r The game is very fun to play alone. Another single-player mode that is worth mentioning is Battle Mode, which is surprisingly addictive and entertaining. Online modes are also present, and they're obviously a ton of fun.

The game's main mode Gran Prix consists of eight Cups, four cups with original race tracks and 4 cups with random tracks from older Mario Kart releases. There is a Mission mode for challenges and boss battles, a single player Ballon Battle mode and Shine Runners mode with AI opponents, a Time Trail mode for you to practice for best times and race ghost data. There are also multiple multiplayer modes including a Download Play demo for friends to try out (your friend will play as a Shyguy of a random colour and you will only have access to two of the eight cups), wireless multiplayer which includes \"Balloon Battle\" \"Shine Runners\" and \"Gran Prix Modes\" and Wifi multiplayer modes which consists of a Gran Prix of 4 races on tracks voted by the players against different player types with include \"Regional\" players from your general area, \"Worldwide\" players from all over the world, \"Rivals\" with similar online records to you and \"Friends\" which you have added to your friends list via registering their friend code. The Wifi multiplayer game gives more than enough replayablility and excitement to encourage players to keep coming back for more and to ensure that buyers get value from their purchase. There are some annoying parts to Wifi multiplayer that needs to be addressed however, some racetrack environmental hazards are disabled to stop players online from desyncing or laging with other opponents, You can't drag items behind your kart to protect yourself from damage for similar lag reasons (this can be somewhat solved by skillfully dropping your item right before a weapon collides with you to block it), there is quite a bit of players online with vulgar usernames or avatars or with hacking tools in use in an attempt to ruin the fun of the game and there are frequent trends of players disconnecting if they feel they are going to lose or it they assume a player is hacking or cheating even if they are not. An amazing game that is well worth the price you pay for it but primitive Wifi multiplayer services (from 2005, one of the first Wifi games for DS) and frustrating behaviours of online players can be a tad bit annoying to get used to.… Expand",

                "Wii Fit feels very much like a version 1.0 trial run that's going to be made obsolete by a better sequel in six months. For now, it's absolutely worth giving it a try if you have a Wii, $90, and some extra pounds to lose.", 
                "That's where the Wii Fit balance board comes in. Just like the Wii itself, it just looks like something you'd like to try out. But once you take that first step onto it, you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit.",

Worse still, the most entertaining 'games' in the package are the ones that improve balance rather than promote weight loss or muscle tone, which potentially damage its 'good for you' fun credentials further. With that said, it's true that any exercise is better than nothing.",

As such, I've given it a 7 rather than a lower score so as to not unfairly lower it's tally. I was super excited about Wii Fit. I'm 33, and I used to have no trouble staying fit during my twenties, as there was always a basketball game, or a volleyball game, or the like to get in on with friends. Now that I've hit my thirties, though, and all my friends are married with children, I've gone about three years without any exercise at all. In that time, I've tacked on 30 pounds of gut, but as someone who hates exercising just for the sake of exercising (I get bored easily) Wii Fit looked like a godsend. Exercising made fun and interactive in the privacy of my own home, whenever I want to exercise? Sounds great, sign me up! In my mind, I hoped that the balance board would be as fun a gaming innovation as the wiimote has been in Wii Sports. Unfortunately, it hasn't turned out that way. None of the games in Wii Fit are that entertaining. The slalom and ski jumping, which I thought would be awesome, are really pretty lame. Okay, so it's still gonna be work and not so much fun, but it's convenient, right? Well, so far, not so much. I've spent about four hours on it, and only amassed an hour and a half of actual exercise time, by its calculations. Sure, the initial session takes extra time because of the initial set-up and the explanations for the exercises, but even my second session was incredibly inefficient. It took me an hour and a half to log on 30 minutes of exercise. And I only watched a couple of exercise demos. Now, as I spend more time at it it will increase the number of reps and duration of the exercises, which should help, but I haven't touched it in a week because I felt like it was doing such a great job of sucking away my time while giving me very little exercise and almost no entertainment value. There are only a few exercises that really feel like significant exercises so far: mainly the side-plank, the lunge, the hula hoop, and the free jogging. Even so, I was able to net a perfect score on the side-plank on each of my first two tries: and I am in terrible shape! Sure, they will add reps, but there just isn't much significant challenge. I actually really enjoy the jogging and the hula hoop, but its a shame that from the start you can't set them for longer durations to give yourself a more efficient work out. Instead, you have to do them in short bursts and constantly start and stop to try and get a decent work out while waiting for the game to open up longer versions. So, in conclusion, as I use Wii Fit more and more it will hopefully get more efficient as I unlock longer and harder versions of the exercises, but if you're looking for entertainment, or a good workout right out of the box, it's just not going to happen. Your going to have to put in the hours just to get the game to open up to the point that you can get a meaningful, decent, and somewhat time efficient exercise program out of it.… Expand",

Once you unlock the more advanced games you get a better workout and can maintain a higher heartrate for 20 or 30 minutes on the free run and the steps. I also think the balance games and the Aerobics games are a lot of fun. Great for family competition. My sister and daughter both live close by and come to compete. It's fun to try to maintain your top 10 slots on the board and knock someone else off.

You see it at the gym with the people with the treadmill set at speed \"2\", complaining that they're not losing weight. Wii Fit lets you get out exactly what you put in, while bringing in a novel and fun way to add exercise into your day, even the days you feel like you can barely drag yourself off the couch for. The exercises are simple, fun, and the presence of your friend's Miis make it feel more familliar. It's easy to be fooled by the simplicity of these exercises - done properly, they can provide an excellent workout. The core training provides an outlet to explore your own center of balance, flexibility, and core awareness that is inventive, creative - and enjoyable. You can easily combine aerobic exercises to make a longer \"cardio\" workout if you desire, especially after you unlock longer distances (which doesn't take long). Four days after getting my Fit, my body is pleasantly achy.. and I wouldn't consider myself among the ranks of the \"unfit\". I managed to string together a well-rounded workout without too much fuss - for those saying it takes too long between exercises, try to continue to run in place while selecting your next exercise. The biggest shortcoming is the inability to streamline through a longer workout (eg. have it \"remember\" your 10 selections) and the lack of multi-player function without having to exit your Mii to the plaza. I'm sure these things will come in the next version, and in the meantime, aren't that much of a big deal with a little creativity. All in all, the Fit provides a great and interesting way to work out for both experienced exercisers and \"couch potatoes\" alike ('cmon \"buff\" people - as IF your abs didn't hurt after your first round of Super Hula Hoop). People complaining about the price amaze me - isn't a regular game around $50-60? At less than double the cost, including the peripheral balance board, this game is excellent value, bound to get you off the couch, and if used properly, bound to make you more \"Fit\"!… Expand",

With some practice at the mini game, we all started to improve and constantly teaching each other how to get higher points which really means how to better balance yourself........... I am a lot more aware of my balance than I ever was and just as a side note, my muscles are really getting one heck of a workout from yoga and muscle workouts and they do work ( much more than I expected them to work cause the reps just keep getting higher as you achieve each mark) This game will be used for a long time to come.… Expand",

Lastly, and most importantly to casual gamers, having to unlock everything is a huge pain. Who has the time to play the game so that everything becomes unlocked?

At 5'8\" and 177 pounds, I'm \"overweight\" according to the BMI metric. Yet on the strength training games, I can easily get \"bodybuilder\" (like, without even picking up the game ever before). Hmm, I wonder why that is...? The game even goes so far as to say \"...BMI is a measure of body fat...\" which is not correct. It is merely a biometric measurement of proportionate weight. Someone could have rippling 8 pack abs and the lowest LDL cholesterol ever and still be obese according to this game, represented by a huge fat version of your Mii. Maybe if everyone did the kinds of exercises in this game - waving video game controllers around and standing - instead of doing actual exercise like weight training and long distance activities, then BMI might be a reasonable measurement of fat, because only people who would be extremely skinny would not be flabby. As it is, the game told me to go down to 145 pounds. I am a grown white man who can run half marathons daily and bench press over 250 pounds - at 145 pounds I would have the physique of a 13 year old, basically. 2.) The exercises are inadequate. Overhead tricep extensions with a Wiimote? Give me a break, maybe if you had me hold about 80 of them it would start to be a workout. The exercise intensity ranges from \"wave your arms around\" to \"do a poor man's version of Dance Dance Revolution\", none of which are appropriately intense for anyone trying to achieve fitness goals. Maybe if they supplied a 250 kg Olympic weight set with the game, it would start to be difficult or rewarding. 3.) Essentially the only lifestyle advice it gives is stuff 5 years olds hear. \"Brush your teeth\" \"go to sleep\" \"don't sit down too long\" \"stand up straight\", as if this is supposed to afford you some kind fitness model physique. There is no appropriate advice for diet, which is probably a good thing since it would no doubt be something like \"eat lots of fruits and vegetables, don't drink too much soda pop, and purchase Nintendo (TM) power bars\". The \"exercises\" performed in this game are utter gash and will not help you achieve any fitness goals unless you can hardly stand to begin with. 4.) Since it's utterly devoid of any purpose in improving anyone's health, the only remaining measure is how good it is as a video game. Let me put it this way. How does running in place for 30 minutes, doing isometric calisthenics for 30 seconds (such as planks), or enduring crappy infrared controller detection and losing games because of it sound to you? If none of that sounds interesting, I would advise you to avoid this purchase, because you're not going to get anything else out of it.… Expand",

There's no doubt for me that it does, and a few minor issues here and there don't get in the way of this game delivering such a lively and large world to explore or from presenting such an entertaining way to do dozens of activities - and I love that for the first time for GTA in nearly a decade, the developers aren't relying so heavily on mind-numbing, straightforward gunfights with thugs and cops.",

GTA V is a better version of GTA IV - and is better in almost every way. Rockstar did it again - the game has class, is smart and is constantly entertaining and amazing. It's like a little universe at your fingertips - you have to come and visit. Yeah.. the race for the Game of the Year title is pretty much over.",

Grand Theft Auto V is the best game in the current console generation, period.",

They will need a lot of creativity and great ingenuity to take the crown from the grip of the king GTA 5. No matter what happens next, a video game has never reached such depth in its gameplay. Gunfights from Max Payne 3, the exploration system from Red Dead Redemption, the driving system from Midnight Club: simply the best from the best. Simply perfect.",

It’s a genuine landmark event in the history of videogames.", 
                "Pull out the clichés and superlatives, because they’re all applicable. GTA 5 is the ultimate milestone for the series, as well as for gaming as a whole. When it comes to scale, detail, character, freedom and spectacle this generation of consoles has reached its absolute peak. It doesn’t trump The Last of Us or BioShock: Infinite in the form of emotional impact, but there’s no other game out there that does this much this well.", 
                "It's the best and the biggest sandbox ever made. The story and how it's told, the deep world around us where there's always something happening, and the amount of content and things to do, make it the perfect closure for this generation.", 
                "Part of what makes the game so generally appealing is that, for the most part, it drops the nagging feeling of “good for an open world game.\"...Grand Theft Auto V is a good shooter and a good driving game with responsive character control. While some of the extras might be spread a little thin, there are no compromises with these central mechanics, which is a feat for a game of this breadth.", 
                "If a picture is worth a thousand words then the game itself is a novel every city block and every dusty trail. It’s the million dollar fireworks display at the end of the current generation cycle of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 – handing out free beer and barbeque chicken wings.", 
                "If anyone is still wondering if GTA has lost its ability to take on the politically correct about ‘appropriate’ content, do not fear, as it is full of violence, social commentary and explicit nature that is sure to aggravate someone with too much time on their hands.", 
                "There’s simply more here than in any game before, and yet quality is never sacrificed for quantity. Personal favourites will persist, but it’s hard to put anything else on top of the pile. Everything you’ve ever wanted a GTA game to be, and a whole lot more. Consistently hilarious, constantly compelling and combining never-before-seen scale and ambition. This is going to make next-gen look bad for a long time to come.",

                "Rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. GTA V is not perfect but has everything you'll ever dream in a sandbox game. San Andreas is gorgeous and full of life, Trevor, Michael and Franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects you won't believe that it runs on an eight years old hardware. It's worth your money, it's worth you time.", 
                "With a swan song to the aging console generation Rockstar once again shows us what Open World really means. The Developer takes a sandbox, blows it up to the size of a football field, fills it with the most beautiful sand and all the toys we really want to play with.", 
                "GTA IV was extraordinarily good, but it took itself a little bit too seriously. GTA V outdoes even San Andreas when it comes to changing up standard shootouts with more wacky, explosive and memorable missions. [October 2013 p.56]", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is the magnum opus of the current generation. It has an amazing game world filled with loads of content and the feeling that you can do literally anything you want. Add three fantastic main characters to it, with their flaws and virtues and you have the recipe for this magnificent game. Nothing less than a masterpiece.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of perfection. It has a bit of everything for everyone in terms of gameplay. A good story mixed with intense action sequences and a large scope to set all of it up in. If this was going to be the last big title from Rockstar on this generation, what a helluva way to go out.", 
                "Editing the GTA formula has been done with love and care. Playing with no less than three main characters works well in every thinkable way, and after finishing the compelling and sharply written story, there’s enough to do in the wide world of Los Santos and environment. GTA 5 simply offers an ambitious, successful experience of a rare quality level.", 
                "San Andreas is vast and sprawling and so much fun to explore. There are thousands of things to do and hundreds of missions, so this will not be a quick playthrough.", 
                "Rockstar Games deserves credit for pushing the boundaries of its flagship franchise yet again with improved controls, great mission variety, and the most jam-packed open world I've ever visited.", 
                "Gigantic and stupidly detailed, GTA V is everything we hoped it would be. Individual components could be a touch better, but when a game does literally everything, nobody can expect perfection across the board. That it even comes close is incredible. [Issue#236, p.62]", 
                "An absolute masterpiece that you can't miss: this is a perfect sequel in the GTA series.",

                "Don't let the missing half-point fool you, Grand Theft Auto V is as good of a retail release you'll find this generation and an excellent coda to this generation for Rockstar.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is a gargantuan accomplishment, with an emphasis on the word “gargantuan.” It may still have an assortment of inconsistencies, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities, but one could argue that such missteps still give this franchise a singular character.", 
                "Time just melted away as I lived a second, third, and fourth life in GTA V. The experience consists of more than just crimes. I played tennis, enrolled in a flight school, captured fugitives, watched movies, and towed cars. A lot of that doesn’t sound fun on paper, but they bring some semblance of real life to a world that otherwise runs on its own bizarre rules.", 
                "Whether you were burned by GTA 4 or not, GTA 5 remembers what the series is all about: emergent sandbox fun and a helluva a lot of murder. You need to play it.", 
                "These characters are voice-acted so annoyingly well that you almost wish the character would never speak again, just like some of the main characters. The music and talk shows are also great to listen to as you are traveling around. All in all, the sound department is not lacking in GTA V.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable achievement. Fun, challenging, satisfying and morally complex, it’s also proof of the ability of games to tackle mature subjects while still being enjoyable diversions, all in service to great characters and a gritty story.", 
                "All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is one of those majorly hyped titles that actually delivers.", 
                "The best way to bid farewell to the retiring consoles is to spend dozens of hours having fun in Los Santos: robbing, abusing illegal substances, breaking all laws and enjoying everything else that GTA V has to offer. And after we finish the game, we should all say loudly: ‘okay, Rockstar girls and boys, it’s high time to make a truly new GTA, not just a gigantic DLC’. [12/2013, p.36]", 
                "Rockstar put tons of time and effort into polishing its winning formula. It isn't a dramatic change for the series, but it's a more polished, and very enjoyable, addition to the franchise.", 
                "A compelling culmination of exact care and attention, Grand Theft Auto V's obsessive attention to detail is matched only by its gripping mission design and clever caricature cast.", 
                "If you’re absolutely opposed to torture, or you need a positive woman character in your game, Grand Theft Auto V is a complete non-starter...Despite my feelings about those things, however, I still found myself having fun outside of them. The rest of the game is good enough that I was up until 3:00 am one night playing mission after mission.", 
                "GTA5 may not be the Hollywood-beating crime story it wants to be, then, but it's the best video game it's ever been, and I'll take that.", 
                "GTA V is an imperfect yet astounding game that has great characters and an innovative and exciting narrative structure, even if the story it uses that structure to tell is hobbled at times by inconsistent character behavior, muddled political messages and rampant misogyny. It also raises the bar for open-world mission design in a big way and has one of the most beautiful, lively, diverse and stimulating worlds ever seen in a game."

To see every single corner of TLOU being so well thought and detailed was amazing and people must understand that to make those incredible details it takes a lot of money and a lot of incredibly talented people. With that been said, GTA V, in every corner, has that uniqueness.\rEverything has been reworked from GTA IV incorporating some of the traits of Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne, Manhunt.\rOk, that was the basic approach of Rockstar. Grand Theft Auto was never great for the story they told. Grand Theft Auto will never have the same level of emotional connection with the player like The Last of Us or Heavy Rain. But that is not a bad thing. With it's three characters, Rockstar tried to do exactly what Resident Evil 6 tried, diversify the boring gameplay of its predecessor (everyone knows GTA IV was basically \"go-kill-comeback\"). Now, GTA V is \"go-dosomething-comeback\". If you liked GTA IV's version of driving fidelity, you're gonna be disappointed, cause everything is way easier when it comes to cars. Shooting is easy and responsive, exactly like Max Payne 3's. Now let's get back to what really matters.\r If you're reading this deciding to buy GTA V, here's what you need to ponder.\rDo you care about story? What kind of story? Do you want to connect with the characters or just have a little laugh here and then?\rIf you're looking for deep, emotional story, GTA V is not for you\rDo you like complex characters? Or you rather have them all figured out from the gate?\rIf you like predictable characters. GTA V is for you. (ps: that is not a bad thing, it's just a way to the a story. If you like Harry Potter, to Lord of the Rings, to Batman, most of its characters are predictable)\rDo you like possibilities? The ability to do the same thing in a variety of ways?\rIf so, GTA V is your game.\rDo you care for multiplayer online?\rGTA Online will be a huge part of GTA V and it looks awesome.\rDo you have enough money to buy every single game you want to have?\rIf you have enough money for one game. GTA V is your game.\rWhy?\rIt has everything.\rIt's a shooter, with a fun yet sometimes a little shallow story, it's a racing game, a tennis game, a golf game, it's got everything from flying and skydiving to riding a submarine, from playing darts to banging hookers. You can buy cars, jets, boats, bikes, stocks, bars, movie theaters.\rIf you're a looking for the perfect metaphor for a game like GTA, you can find it in RPGs.\rGTA never wanted to be ONE thing, a wizard or a warrior, GTA tries to be everything, never being perfect in those things, but they have such talented people, time and a lot of money to be very, very good in those things.\rSo if you, like some people like to do, strip it down and analyze it piece by piece, GTA V probably will get poor grades. It is a lousy tennis game, a pathetic racing game...but GTA V is not anyone of those things. We are limited by the technology and the market to have a perfect game.\rThere will never be a game with open world meticulously created, that is also the biggest map ever, with deep, complex characters, living the greatest story ever told, while also being a Gran Turismo when you get a car, a Battlefield when you pull your gun...it is impossible.\rGTA V is a game that does nothing perfect, but trying to do everything it creates its own category, and even if it doesn't succeed at being perfect, it is so well thought and made, such care was put in every detail, that every other game could learn from it. GTA V is a 10/10 not because it is perfect, but because its flaws are the gap between genres. GTA V can be the single point from where all the other games branch out in a single direction and the others that try to compare and be everything just can't match this level of care.… Expand",

Needless to say, I was apprehensive about the 5th installment, But let me be clear, this is the most cohesive gaming experience I've had in a long while, letting it contend with The Last of Us as my favorite game of this generation.\rThe cars handle much better, and they've borrowed almost all of what really worked from RDR, making the problems I had from 4 a thing of the past. The world is absolutely massive, but an important thing to note is that none of it seems wasted. Buildings seemingly lack the cut and paste of previous iterations, creating an extremely immersive setting for a sandbox. The graphic qualities are great, only made even better by the detailed lighting. The sheen on a car or the blurring of light in the background are stellar and  make everything feel true to life.\rThe story is an obvious. Rockstar pumps out another quality script, putting satire to good use. It did, however, feel strange and a little disturbing to have no outward motive to rob banks other than just wanting money. These guys aren't anti-heroes, they're just villains, albeit extremely likable. It plays with your perception of right and wrong.\rThere are a few nit picks I have, but they honestly can be overlooked for the most part.\rTHIS IS WHAT A GAME CAN BE WHEN DEVELOPERS ARE GIVEN PROPER TIME.

When online heists arrive, that will be when GTA Online will live up to its potential. As for now, GTA V is an amazing game and a true testament to the powers of the PS3 and Xbox 360.

This is the first game I have ever let the hype get a hold of me before the launch and not come away disappointed in some way or another. Seriously. Rockstar has delivered on everything, every aspect and every nook and cranny.  This metric they use to rate games should be blown apart by this game smashing through the \"10\" ceiling and blasting off into outer space.\r I dare to say, I would not be surprised if the people giving the bad user reviews are jealous because they for some reason cant play it and can only find solace is trying to prevent others from enjoying it too by attempting to lower its user score. That is the only reason i can think for this game having a 8.1 user score at the time of this review.   It makes no sense to me that anybody who has played it could give it anything less than a perfect score, a 9 at the lowest for those super hard to please grumpy folks maybe.\r Anyway, about the game, the story is what you would expect from a Rockstar game, over the top but grounded just enough to make it seem possible. The decision to move to three protagonist was genius. There is always something to do and each has their own wallet, stats and personal belongings to maximize.\r The graphics are amazing for running on 7 year old hardware. I have no idea how they did it but they did. I cant wait to see what the PS4/XBone/PC maybe versions look like.  Very few pop outs or glitches on my PS3 version.\r The amount of customization in this game is absurd, the weapon customization is what you would find in a current gen Call of Duty game and the vehicle customization is almost on par with Forza and Gran Turismo, and this is a GTA game!!\r To be honest, I am still in shock.

I saw a lot of people on here day 1 of the game's release bashing it when they didn't even have a good amount of play time put into the game. I have put 25 hours in to the game so far, and I still feel like there's so much more for me to see and do. From the get go, you can already see how much there is to explore. I was initially disappointed the city portion of the map was  small in comparison to the rest of the map, but when you're in the game it feels like a large, full sized city. The game gives you a lot to do, as there are multiple side missions, random encounters with people getting robbed or having their bike get stolen, and it even lets you invest in the stock market. The biggest changes in this entry would be the shooting and driving mechanics. Everything has been tweaked and feels tighter and much more responsive. Vehicles don't swerve all over the road like in GTA IV, and the shooting is heavily borrowed from Rockstar's own Max Payne 3 which is a good thing. The stories for the three main characters are all really interesting. The characters themselves live very different lives, which helps make the missions more varied. That is perhaps one of the best improvements of the new game, is that the missions are now much more varied. Nearly every mission is different from the last, and it helps keep the game interesting. The biggest missions in the game are these elaborate heists, in which the player actually gets to choose between two options of how they want to go through a heist, and who they to go through heist with as their crew. These are the highlights of the game in terms of missions and they near always give the user some much needed cash as there is a lot to spend your money on in this game.  For the first time in a GTA game, you can actually buy a vehicle legally, through the game's internet, and it will be delivered to your garage. Vehicle customization and character customization are both back from San Andreas. The car customization, while not very extensive as far as what you can do to the body, is fun and lets you have your own custom car, as well as letting you improve the vehicle's performance. The game is a lot of fun, and despite some texture glitches here and there and some frame-rate slow down, it is as near perfect of a game as a sandbox could ever hope to be.

I have always gone back to Vice City when wanting to play a bit of casual GTA. For me Vice City was a hassle free fun open world game at the time something really quite special, from the musicGTA V  A Bright New Future\r For me I have always loved Grand Theft Auto games, my first game being Vice City, and then going back in the series to GTA 3, and then of course San Andreas and GTA 4. I have always gone back to Vice City when wanting to play a bit of casual GTA. For me Vice City was a hassle free fun open world game at the time something really quite special, from the music to the cars to the compelling story line it has always been a deep rooted personal best when it comes to gaming. Most recently in the series GTA 4 was impressive the new world was a tall new world and was exciting to explore, but it always felt 'dark' to me, there's no other way to explain it, just 'dark'.\r So when I saw the gameplay and trailers of the latest development of Grand Theft Auto from Rockstar I was excited, it seemed they were really taking a massive leap forward in the open world game. And when I received my game today my expectations were met. The game is bright and open, the map is dense yet personal, getting to know the areas around Michael's and Franklin's house's has been a joy. The city feels alive, the free ways feel real, and the desserts are superb to explore.\r The brightness has well and truly been turned up, but it's not just the stunning graphics and huge new world we have to enjoy. We now have three characters, to begin with it felt complex and slightly annoying having to switch characters in high octane situations, but bit by bit, mission by mission it's starting to feel a little more fluid, I'm not there yet and it still feels slightly confusing, but I am sure as the missions get more complex the enjoyment from switching perspectives will increase. The three characters are so different and interesting in their different ways. I must admit I wasn't massively looking forward to playing with Trevor but his 'different' personality has become something you just want to explore more and more. Michael continues to be my favoured character. I really enjoyed the growing dynamic of Franklin and Michael, and seeing it develop into the first heist was great.\r I have enjoyed the driving and find the mechanics enjoyable and realistic, I can see why some do not like these, but I just think it's a case of getting used to it. There are so many different cars and other road traffic to see and drive. I thought the amount of different looking buses was amazing, as small a detail as it may be it just felt nothing had been ignored. The roads are highly detailed in the city, and feel real to real life cities roads the road markings for example have been developed further. In addition the road driving AI are much more realistic and add to the experience.\r The missions are different and interesting, however can sometimes be slightly tedious and mundane but still excite in many areas. And it's all worth it for the heists, were I thought they freedom given to players is a class act from Rockstar. I was also very impressed with how choosing different crew members not only had a real difference on the outcome but also a difference on the dialogue between characters, very interesting indeed!\r The small mini games are fun and put GTA into a league of it's own. I loved the triathlon game and am looking forward to developing my skills further. Tennis and Yoga also exsist. With access to stock markets and transport and real estate markets adding an extra dimension to an already jam-packed game. With GTA you really do get a full game, there is no skimping from Rockstar, no corner cutting, and it is fully worth their long waits between games, when you get such a polished and finished game.\r For me Grand Theft Auto is the pinnacle of gaming, it is a game that has thought of just about everything, Rockstar haven't rushed a game out to try and make money with minimal improvements (Saints Row 4 springs to mind here) They have spent a great deal of time and money and resources to making a stunning looking, and compelling to play gameplay. For me GTA is the best all round game I have ever played, it perhaps doesn't come close to other games in certain areas, for example dialogues and emotion goes to The Last of Us. But Rockstar have delivered on what were monumental expectations, for me GTA V will always go down as a game changer. It's very fitting that perhaps the best game ever of this current generation will be this generations swan song.

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nI am at about 60% through the game, or game completion. No clue what that translates into storywise. I have been completing side missions and story missions pretty much evenly paced. Let me just say this, I love this game, it is one of the best, ever.\rBut, there ARE some issues with it: First off, the graphics. They could be better, not on the PS3 or X360, then again my personal opinion is it should have been released for next gen, not current. The graphics are nice, don't get me wrong, but in this game the limitations of the hardware being used is the most apparent, ever.\rSecond off: The map is huge, Ill give it that, but it I had been led to believe that there was more to be done. I don't know what I feel is missing, but something is missing, there are loads of side quests, I agree, but after one, two or three they all drop to a single common denominator, and it becomes just a thing to do. Entirely skippable, which I guess side missions would be, but I desired a bit more oomph.\rThird off: Controls; now for the most part the controls work, and work really well. But sometimes, and by sometimes it feels often since it is ALWAYS at the worst possible time it could happen, they  up. Your character will spasm or do something you did NOT tell him to do, and then your dead. Not that dying really matters, 5grand and your good to go again, you'll even keep your weapons, but lose your car.\rFourth: Cars don't get properly saved, so I have wasted a good 100k bucks on fitting and refitting cars, just to have them disappear, apparently rockstar is on the bug and will have a fix for it soon.\r Might seem overly critical, but in essence, these are minor things, at least for me, still felt they were worth mentioning. If you, like me, find that these things are minor, then get the game now. GTA V scores heavily on story, audio (VA included), gameplay (by and large, most control mechanics work really well, except for on foot and the ****ing choppers), size and scope, and also the idea of three protagonists. I have not at all regretted this purchase, and most others won't either. I will most likely get the game for PC aswell, when it comes out.… Expand", 
                "Rockstar has highlighted once again why they are the best developer in the business with their latest installment of Grand Theft Auto.\r Grand Theft Auto 5 excels in so many different ways its beyond belief its almost impossible to praise everything in this game because of the sheer amount of content and possibilities, and is fully deserving of all the positive reviews and scores it hasRockstar has highlighted once again why they are the best developer in the business with their latest installment of Grand Theft Auto.\r Grand Theft Auto 5 excels in so many different ways its beyond belief its almost impossible to praise everything in this game because of the sheer amount of content and possibilities, and is fully deserving of all the positive reviews and scores it has achieved thus far.\r The story telling in this game is absolutely sublime, and everyone involved in the voice overs and acting has done an excellent job of portraying their characters in a way which other video games are unable to do.\r Improved mechanics in this game has given us many games rolled into one, the driving is superb and at one point blasting through the hills in Vinewood, it felt like the Need for Speed game we always wanted, but without the awful forced drifting. The shooting mechanics for GTA as always are fantastic, and at last have made it more of a challenge to shoot with the buzzards in comparison to TBOGT.\r There is a reason this game has becoming the fastest selling entertainment product to hit £1billion of all time, and its because quite frankly this is the greatest game ever created and puts the developers who rehash the same game every year such as Activision, to shame. Rockstar have taken their time and delivered on everything we wanted and then some, from owning pets in the game, to heists online and even rallying.\r The added entity of GTA Online isnt even out yet, and already GTA 5 has received worldwide acclaim, lord only knows the kind of praise it will get on October 1st.\r Overall, this game is a graphical masterpiece with everything we ever needed, from being able to hunt in the wilderness, to modding cars and having our NFS fun, to planning bank robberies and stealing fighter jets from the military, there really is very little left out when you fully play this game, and even after you think you've seen and done it all, the game throws something else at you.\r My advice, ignore the negative reviews from those Call of Duty fan boys, they will all run off this game when Ghosts drops later in the year, and read the reviews of the overall gamers who play all games to a solid level. GTA 5 is a MUST play game, just like Skyrim was a few years ago, and LA Noire a few years before that, its a game which yet again has changed what we perceive as great, in this constantly evolving industry.… Expand",

                "A manifesto for every future video game. Now we've seen what can be done when truly brilliant people get to make a world brimming with variety, music, humour and sheer scale, very few other games are going to be able to live up to it. [PSW]", 
                "I can't express in words to do the game justice how large and well drawn out these cities are.", 
                "A game that surpasses its genre-defining predecessors in every respect, not just in terms of gameplay, but also in terms of story, characters, and overall fun. It pops many caps in many asses. [Jan 2005, p.58]", 
                "So good that it even drew Axl Rose out of hiding (he’s the DJ on the classic rock station, one of 11 listening formats), San Andreas cranks out even more action than \"Vice City\" as you engage in those wacky gang-related adventures you've grown to love in disconcertingly authentic versions of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.", 
                "Take a large measure of \"GTA III\"; add a sprinkle of \"Vice City\", freshly sliced sprigs of nineties gang culture; stir in dashes of \"Manhunt\", \"Fable\", and \"Dance-Dance Revolution\" to taste, then mix in a nitro-powered-blender from hell. Result? Ten out of ten.", 
                "It's like 5 games in one: part RPG, part adventure, part action, part racer and part sim. And it does it just as well as the best games in any of those genres...One of the best games ever released on any system.",

                "A masterpiece; the outstanding gameplay from the first two games has been extended, tweaked and applied to a fresh, original and fascinating setting. There's more than enough meat to keep you going for months, and the sheer variety of gameplay is bewildering.", 
                "Not only a masterpiece, it's the finest game currently available for the PS2. Buy it now, but don't make any plans for a couple months at least.", 
                "A true platform defining title; in 20 years time gamers will look back at the Playstation2 and hold GTA: San Andreas as the true epoch-making title of the times. Nothing can be understated, RockStar North have truly delivered beyond everybody’s expectations.", 
                "San Andreas is shocking, not necessarily because of its typically contentious subject matter (though there's plenty in it to rub those of a conservative disposition the wrong way) but because of the sheer scale of the experience...Is it really the best game ever made? Quite possibly, yes.", 
                "The best game on the PS2.", 
                "The graphical effects in this title are far superior to anything GTA conjured up previously. On hot days you'll see an intense heat in front of you in the form of lots and lots of orange sunlight and heat waves in the distance. The sunsets and sunrises during hot times are absolutely blinding!", 
                "I usually complain that many single player games these days do not have much in the way of \"replayability\". That is one aspect where San Andreas sets the bar so ridiculously high, that I can't imagine any non-GTA games coming anywhere near it for years to come.", 
                "Freedom has always been the GTA hallmark, and in that regard, San Andreas piles on the features to ludicrous proportions. Comparing San Andreas to any other game is like comparing King Kong to the other monkeys; it is the Overgame.", 
                "There really is no other game like it, despite there being many imitators, and this is precisely the kind of experience that reminds why, exactly, we play games: to be liberated from the constraints of reality, and explore living, breathing worlds. Few games have come this close to realizing that promise.", 
                "Once again, Rockstar Games and Rockstar North have changed gaming as we know it...The variety of missions in San Andreas is staggering, as there's literally hundreds of varied tasks that will help you gain respect.", 
                "Despite minor flaws, this is by far the most enjoyable game in the GTA series, and will eat well over 100 hours of your time.", 
                "The word “massive” doesn’t begin to describe the entire state of San Andreas and exploring it without any load times is like the cherry on top of an overly sweetened cake.  Driving has been tightened to perfection and the changes to the targeting system makes popping caps on fools so much better.", 
                "It's about being in one long and deeply worthwhile experience that manages to do the impossible and improve on what has gone before, and then has the confidence to expand itself to a size that defies belief. Pack some sandwiches, it's going to be a long trip.", 
                "In short, it's a terrific unending masterpiece of a game -- and one that will never fall victim to an over-exaggeration of its lofty status. It's the defining piece of software for Sony's successful sophomore system, and it's almost impossible to imagine a PlayStation 2 library without it.", 
                "Shudderingly comprehensive, divinely paced and - despite the million of words already written in feverish anticipation - it has the ability to surprise at every turn. This is PS2's defining masterpiece – a sunspot of rare polished magic from experienced developers working at the peak of their powers. [PSM2]", 
                "Play mechanics, the movie-epic plot, the sheer scope of the landscape and the missions—all combine to create the most near-perfect experience that I have ever had with a game.", 
                "Without a doubt the greatest game every created on the Playstation 2 videogame system. It is the best hands-down. No other game can come even close to this one...The possibilities of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas are endless.", 
                "A stunning achievement for both Rockstar and Sony. It shows just how powerful the PS2 system is when used right. This game has the potential to last months and months on end, especially for the 100% target.", 
                "The story to San Andreas is by far the best of any GTA game to date. As you progress, you will experience turning points to this story that drive you to see the next cutscene, something that has never been done in a GTA game before.", 
                "The game’s targeting system has been improved and is very reminiscent of the developer’s \"Manhunt,\" which overall makes it more cohesive. The game allows you to get better with guns and you’ll have different phases, which will give you more control over your shooting abilities.", 
                "While I can't say that GTA: San Andreas is another revolution in gaming like GTA3 was, it is an evolution that goes light years beyond what we saw with the last two titles in the series.", 
                "Only the graphical bugs, slow-down and other nit picks associated with the fact that the game is pushing the aging PS2 to its limits keeps this from being the first perfect entry into the series.", 
                "Thanks to the sheer level of detail and the amount of gameplay you'll be able to engage in during C.J.'s adventures, San Andreas surpasses just about any game that’s come along in the PS2’s history.", 
                "The amount of attributes that you can actually improve is staggering. CJ must learn how to drive, shoot, swim, workout, be healthy, sprint and participate in relationships.", 
                "With its strong story, well-written dialogue, terrific voice cast, impressive graphics, great in-game sound, and extremely entertaining and varied gameplay, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a stupendous thrill ride that shouldn't be missed.", 
                "This could very well be remembered as the PlayStation 2's best game ever.", 
                "As far as actual content goes, I don’t think there’s been a game in history with more, so you almost need to own this game just so you can see how packed a game can be.", 
                "When you take the scope of the entire game into considerations, San Andreas is a real technical feat.", 
                "It is hard to find a game with the perfect blend of unique, action packed missions and interesting and enthralling non-mission events, but Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas pulls it off in convincing fashion.", 
                "There's so much to do in this game that it's outside of my range of imagination to be able to picture me reaching a 100% complete. Unfathomable.", 
                "The second you start playing this game you realise that the latest Rockstar title is about a hundred times more complex than its predecessors. Not only is there a load of new weapons, cars and a huge new environment available, but the gaming experience itself has completely evolved.", 
                "It is, in my opinion, the best single player experience available right now.", 
                "A weaker soundtrack and nagging problems with the interface take the game down just shy of getting a full 10, but this is the digital embodiment of a killer app.", 
                "Calling this game huge is an understatement...All told, San Andreas is about four times the size of any previous GTA game.", 
                "This is arguably the most important videogame this year - yes, even more important than \"Halo 2\" - not only because it's a superbly crafted videogame, but because it's also a bona fide sociological artifact, one that manages to effectively evoke a specific time and place in American history—in this case, a hot and hazy California during the nascent days of hip-hop culture.", 
                "The minor control problems, reoccurring graphical bugs, and the generally similar core gameplay as before keep the game's score down a tad from what it could be, but the ridiculous amount of content and pure value available here is second to none. It doesn’t completely redefine the series.", 
                "A masterful blend of storyline, exciting action, and freeform gameplay that will keep you hooked for hours on end.", 
                "There is personality and atmosphere everywhere in this game and even small things such as the body language of pedestrians sets the scene in every neighbourhood you visit.", 
                "Surprisingly easy to pick up, and startlingly difficult to master, San Andreas offers the most complete gaming package ever made on the current generation of consoles.", 
                "No one should deny that San Andreas is a great storytelling game. It's just that, between gradually caring less and less about the main characters, and performing many game actions that are nearly identical to those of previous titles in the series, San Andreas could easily begin to wear a bit thin.", 
                "This game has so many new innovations that it leaves its predecessors in the dust.", 
                "My biggest beef with San Andreas is the implementation of the gang warfare system...It takes away a certain element that was found in the earlier games, that of the feeling that you were running an entire city.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is to the gaming world what \"The Matrix\" was to the film industry: it breaks so much ground and introduces so many significant things that it will no doubt have an impact on how games are made for a long time to come.", 
                "GTA may be looking its age and some of its more favoured structural ideas are beginning to feel a little dated, but Rockstar continue to revel in the mastery of presenting a consuming environment to the player and inviting them to do within it what they wish.", 
                "San Andreas's chief advantage over \"Vice City\" is size. And for many players, that's good enough. But another group of fans will come to quietly understand that, at least for the time being, \"Vice City\" remains the high point of the GTA series.", 
                "The fact that you can do whatever you want, gunning down rival gang members, impressing the girls, robbing the rich, breaking into the Army Depot, whether it is flying a plane, or pimping out your car, playing some pool, riding across country, the game play is endless.", 
                "As with previous GTA games there's lots to criticise, but San Andreas survives, scathed but still walking tall, buoyed by the kind of ambition that sees most games crumble under the weight of it all. It's a multi-faceted, multi-achieving experience, a rough-edged but massively substantial landmark. [Christmas 2004, p.78]", 
                "I have to subtract a point for what, in my opinion, is a total lack of overall upgrading. While there are hundreds of more things to do in San Andreas, I feel, in my heart of hearts, that the game looks and plays just like its two predecessors.", 
                "One of the game's biggest achievements, however, is that it actually gets you to care about Carl and his friends - the other gang members who ride and fight with you on most missions. They all seem to have their own personalities and come across as being fully-realized characters.", 
                "There is also a distinct lack of overall polish, mostly noticeable in the smallest ways: ugly character models, cluttered maps (the custom waypoint is a welcomed and downright necessary addition), unnecessarily complex wardrobe management, odd misspellings (\"Cobra Marital Arts\"), and even repeated references to Los Angeles instead of Los Santos.", 
                "San Andreas' greatest success is that it gives us more space for our imaginations than most other games do, and ties together the edges neatly with a well-crafted story and missions, adding up to a whole that few games can compare to.", 
                "San Andreas is a true epic, but no game should be this frustrating.", 
                "The seamless way in which the DJs react to the in-game environment, and from an intertextual standpoint, merge better with the player's situation far more effectively than in the previous games is just inspiring.", 
                "Enormous, diverse, engrossing, daring, liberating, sophisticated and -- most of all -- ambitious. Yet at the same time it can be restrictive, banal, childish, unpolished and -- most of all -- frustrating.", 
                "What you have here is the most polished, feature-laden, action-packed Grand Theft Auto title to-date. I've had my qualms with the franchise in the past but this is the first time that I was able to sit back, shut off my brain and enjoy the experience.", 
                "Between its towering mountains and vast waters there are surprises, in-jokes and events in San Andreas to fill at least a hundred hours. Should \"GTA4\" be any more involving, there’ll be no one left to see how GTA5 turns out. Half of us will no longer have the jobs to afford it; the other half will be motoring back and forth in the neighbours’ stolen car, endlessly prowling for prostitutes.", 
                "It's no exaggeration to say that you could be still be playing this when the next GTA game comes out, even if it takes Rockstar another two years to finish. It's not perfect then, but so much of it is so good that you won't care.", 
                "Your legacy will be as twisted, as exciting or as brutal as your imagination will allow... San Andreas is an experience as unique as you are. Sometimes, it’s okay to believe the hype. [Christmas 2004, p.98]", 
                "The amount of things to do in the cities of Los Santos, San Fierro, and Las Venturas is absolutely staggering... In my opinion there’s no excuse to not have a “save anywhere” feature included.", 
                "Bigger and richer in every way - a near bottomless game painted end-to-end with stuff to do, or not. As far as free-form gaming goes, it remains the pinnacle. [Jan 2005, p.57]", 
                "A thrilling, albeit frustrating, gaming experience that will have you yelling for joy one minute then screaming in anger the next.",

Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home. His mother has been murdered, his family has fallen apart and his childhood friends are all heading towards disaster. On his return to the neighborhood, a couple of corrupt cops frame him for homicide. CJ is forced on a journey that takes him across the entire state of San Andreas, to save his family and to take control of the streets. [Rockstar]",

Apart from rather bad graphics, which were mostly down to an old engine, aging hardware, and disc limitations of the time, San Andreas would score high on the charts of any generic rating system. It took the already well established, if slightly repetitive formula of it's predecessor, Vice City, and expanded, refreshed, and improved every aspect. Each gameplay detail was refined, although the basic GTA formula stayed in place. This left some core elements some gamers would dislike, but the masses, the critics, and myself, couldn't get enough of the best offering the GTA series had to offer. Storyline, audio, presentation, all packaged into a game where, with a little progression, you could unlock many more locations, vehicles, weapons, and gameplay elements (Who could forget the jetpack in all it's obscure glory?) than many other games of the time, made GTA one of the best games ever developed for the PS2 system.

The game's map is just ginormous consisting of three cities Los Santos (based on LA), San Fierro (based on San Francisco) and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas). The large map also has forest and desert like environments it is amazing how this game captured the feel of three different cities and its citizens but also shows the way the cowboys and villiagers live their loves in the forest and the desert. GTA San Andreas has just a great story which could be confusing early on however the player will understand more and more things as he progresses the game's story is very deep, enthralling and personal also more involving and darker than its predecessors. I also like the main character of this game Carl Johnson he has a very funny. charming and likeable personality a type of person who can be sarcastic and funny along with being a total bada** and serious at the same time. The game also includes some rpg stats unlike 3 and Vice City which include Respect, Fat, Muscle that can change the way CJ looks. The player can also buy different kinds of clothes , different haircuts and tattoos to make the CJ look exactly like he wants, the player can also customize and mod different Vehicles the customization options in this game are just really well done, Sex Appeal, Driving and Gun Skills/Stats have also been implemented in the game the more player drives and the more he uses guns his skills improve and the better the player gets at them for example the player will be able to drive cars easily when his skills improve, and being able to use two SMGS at the same time and move while shooting as the player gets good with guns. The game has so much side stuff that it is impossible for me to cover in all of them in this review but the ones on the top of my head are: car, bike and plane races, car, bike, boat and plane schools, GYMs, girlfriends, gang Wars, Casinos, Quarry missions, some Asset missions as well as Police, Taxi and Ambulance missions thats not even all. The amount of side stuff put the side things in GTA 4 to shame. GTA San Andreas also has great music and songs which are all a great kickback to the 1990s and all the types of music are there Rock Music, Country Music, Rap Music and even talk shows infact the player can just enjoy and have fun in the game driving around in cars and bikes while listening to these Radio Stations alone thats how awesome the Radio Stations are in this game. The voice acting is just perfect there is no other word I can use to describe it, it seems like all the people who are doing the voice acting are deep into their characters. The game's graphics are good considering its ps2, the game is so huge and it came out in 2004 so its graphics are understandable, the environments looks just beautiful, character models are more detailed than previous GTAs but the characters stiff finger attached hands can look really weird at times. There is a multiplayer mode in this game unlike previous GTAs while it is not amazing or anything the player can still have alot of fun with his friends while free roaming with them or doing co-op rampage missions it is not perfect but it is better to have a multiplayer mode which is fun but not perfect than have no multiplayer at all. The game's story is around 25-30 hours long however in trying to do all the sidestuff in this and unlocking all things, getting 100% completion the player can spend hours and hours in this game and completely get lost in it amazing world and atmosphere. GTA San Andreas is a classic and a masterpiece of a game and in my honest opinion the best game in the GTA series and one of best sandbox games of all time. 10/10.… Expand",

The controls are really good but the foot controls are kind of wierd, the gunplay is a little lose and it sucks that there is no cover system but this is all very minor compared to the rest of the game. The characters in San Andreas are all really robust and alive, each with their own qualities that makes them so special and the voice acting and sounds are top of the line well the guns sound more like paintball guns so that is dumb but again just a tiny insignificant error. Overall, San Andreas is a great game that does not dissapoint at all, it is a great GTA game worth your time and it is probably the best game on the PS2.

The gang mechanics were sort of spot on (Had it's flaws) but it's a game from 2004, so I'm not complaining. The customization was taken to the next level. No GTA so far has been able to match the customization of San Andreas. From weight lifting, to abilties, to gaining weight losing weight, to learning new fighting styles, to customizing your car, different types of clothing, etc. I would say the customization was the best part of the gang.

I remember very well when this game came out: everyone talked about it, everyone praised it, everyone wanted it, and everyone had it. Many players had appreciated San Andreas because you could do what you wanted and because it was full of cheats. I agree about the freedom the game give you, and yes, cheats were really beautiful and fun.\r But what lies beneath San Andreas is something much deeper and bigger. The setting was magnificent, set in the fictional state of San Andreas. Not to mention the historical context of the early 90s (it was set in 1992), with a fantastic background of uses and costumes, such as music, vehicles, weapons and clothes of that time. The plot was magnificent, rich in actuality as gang warfare, drugs, corruption, shootouts, bank robberies and even more that slowly drag the player down to the slums of the 90s. Among other things, the plot was rooted upon real events as the \"East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry\" and the \"Rampart scandal\". Things that still today have their weight on culture and on contemporary history.\r The gameplay of San Andreas was great: you could do whatever you wanted, right from the start. You could go where you wanted, and turn around the entire map, which was also quite large. You had to eat and drink, or you could go to the gym, or you could gamble, or you could have a girlfriend, or you could kill anyone you wanted also. You could change your clothes and also (and this is not possible in other GTA games) change your appearance, become leaner, more fat, more muscular. You could develop your skills with weapons or driving vehicles. Indeed, from a point of view of gameplay, San Andreas is the deeper and complete chapter of the entire serie, and it felt just like a real rpg-game.\r The graphics of San Andreas was not as beautiful as God of War and Metal Gear Solid, however, was more than acceptable and some views as the one of Vinewood were really fascinating.\r What else to say? Nothing, except that I recommend this game to anyone, and I consider him a true timeless masterpiece and an important legacy of the early 2000s.

I love SA and still play it to this day. Who says classics are bad?… Expand"

                "Arguably the culmination of Rockstar’s work so far, GTA V incorporates the best of their back catalogue; the car handling from Midnight Club: Los Angeles, the vast fauna-populated scrublands from Red Dead Redemption, and the gunplay and bullet time from Max Payne, folding them in to form an experience unparalleled in variety.", 
                "I could do all of those things, but I’d rather just say that GTA V is as close to a perfection of the Grand Theft Auto formula as has been created thus far. If you have any interest at all, it should already be installing on your system.", 
                "At first sight just another well-executed GTA game, which is by itself a great excuse for our ultimate rating. When you look at it for a second time, you'll get the incredibly immersive and entertaining world that will not let you free. There are flaws indeed. But you know what? When you love it nothing else matters.", 
                "Rockstar Games have unleashed the Skyrim of third-person action games. It'll have a lasting impact through controversy, through harshly addictive gameplay, and by taking the zeitgeist of 18-36 year-old males hostage and torturing them with nipple clamps.", 
                "With Grand Theft Auto V Rockstar has delivered one of the most amazing and awe-inspiring games of this generation. Even if you are not a fan of the series, the incredible level of detail, the three main character switching mechanic, the bank heists and the hilarious story make this game a must.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V expertly blends the best aspects of the last two major releases in the series, GTA IV and San Andreas, to set a new standard in open-world action. In a year already packed with titles that have pushed aging console hardware to new extremes, GTA V might stand as the crowning technical and design accomplishment.", 
                "GTA V is funny, genuinely laugh out loud funny – and not in a ’shoving a ten-inch purple dildo up your arse’ funny – the humour is told through situation, through incredibly clever writing and wonderful sense of place. Really, that says everything you need to know about GTA V. Rockstar has spent five years, and an insane amount of money, building a game that is not only bold enough to step away from expectation, but brave enough to revel in its combined history as well.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of the franchise and of gaming in 2013. A ridiculously ambitious title that wrings absolutely everything out of the aging seventh-gen consoles, it's a spectacular triumph in every conceivable way. Rejoice, for Rockstar North has done it again.", 
                "Make no mistake: this game is beyond heavyweight. In many ways, Grand Theft Auto V is a culmination of the current generation; it’s a summation of everything we’ve seen in the last eight years, a love letter, if you like, to the 360 and the PS3.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is the pinnacle of open-world video game design and a colossal feat of technical engineering. It takes a template laid down by its predecessors and expands upon it, improving on and streamlining some of its rougher aspects. It doesn’t break out of that template and can be brash, nasty and nihilistic. But for all its more unsavoury aspects, this is a game built with skilled mechanical expertise and creative artistry.", 
                "The genius of GTA V is in the sheer seductive force of its vision. The visuals are astonishing – just astonishing. Surely pushing this ageing hardware to the limits, we get the dense downtown with its soaring skyscrapers and murky, rubbish-strewn back alleys. But then out into the country, we have rolling grasslands and desert stretches, coyotes roaming, the shadows of eagles swooping overhead...The world drags you in. It begs you to explore – and then it rewards you.", 
                "When analyzed in its purest essence, GTA V not only proves to be an excellent title, but also a game that is able to make a sublime parody of today's society, taking advantage of all the excesses and insanities to which the world is slowly getting used.", 
                "GTA V is not only bigger and funnier than the amazing Niko Bellic’s tragedy, it's also better. With a ton of mission variety, amazing visuals and fantastic gameplay, this is the biggest game ever made.", 
                "Memorable missions, barnstorming heists, amusing side objectives and an almost impossibly immersive world to explore, make for the best Grand Theft Auto since Vice City and San Andreas.", 
                "Getting through the main story in a timely manner was a challenge in itself, but in that time I found that GTA V was possibly the most well-paced open world game I have ever played. I never felt like I didn’t have something to do and as of right now, I’m going right back in to do it all over again. I’ve been with GTA since the beginning way back in ‘97, and it feels like GTA V is the culmination of everything we love about the series: It’s big, it’s pretty, and most importantly it’s just nonstop fun.", 
                "With a great cast, a huge list of missions and activities, some novel new gameplay additions and one of the most stunning environments we've ever explored, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece and a hugely impressive technological achievement.", 
                "The world is massive and detailed, the gameplay is damn near perfect, and though there are some lackluster side missions, the actual story is filled with memorable personalities that feel more fully-realized than even the best of GTA's previous characters.", 
                "Sam Houser compared the making of Rockstar’s epic to the troubled production of Francis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, and in some ways the same result has been met: a product that represents the peak of the blockbuster triple-A form, that realises grand ambition without visible compromise.", 
                "The fifth game in the series combines the delusions of grandeur facilitated by the most detailed open world to date to super-solid shooting and driving mechanics. Previous lengths have been traded in for a consistently captivating narrative which not only holds everything together, but really makes this game seem more than the sum of its parts. The only remaining question is: Where will – or can –the series go from here? I am looking forward to finding out.", 
                "Rockstar revolutionizes gaming once again, implementing three playable characters whilst further pushing the limits of the criminal life in a virtual playground.", 
                "The quality of GTA V puts to shame 99% of triple A productions. The story is beautiful, the graphics are unbelievable for the old hardware they run on, and most importantly the gameplay is fun and smooth. GTA V is not afraid to show it is a videogame, and has the guts to trade some of its realism for the sake of fun.", 
                "GTA V feels like a next-gen game without actually being one. If all the other studious could do what Rockstar can, there'd be plenty of life left in the current console generation. But that's the thing, isn't it. No other developer is like Rockstar. And no other series is like Grand Theft Auto.", 
                "GTA V represents the videogame at its finest. Tense and dramatic when it wants, joyful and surprising when the player wants it. Rockstar has managed to harmonize the different trends in the saga, managing to create an unforgettable experience that will be enjoyed for a long time to come.", 
                "A staggering technical achievement that is matched only by the depth and ambition of its gameplay – this is not only the best-looking GTA ever but by far the most fun to play.", 
                "Unless you play it for yourself, it's near impossible to grasp how big GTA 5 is. It's not just the world. It's the gargantuan story, the sheer amount of missions and the variety introduced with them, the activities to take part in, or the secrets waiting to be unveiled. It's a highlight of the generation.", 
                "It features arguably the best story of the series that’s greatly enhanced by the added dynamic of three contrasting protagonists.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago.", 
                "From skydiving and submarine exploration to bounty-hunting and watching animated shorts, GTA V is absolutely crammed full of things to do, and it looks amazing while you do them.", 
                "Rockstar's Xbox 360 swansong is probably the console's greatest technical achievement, and as such it's unmissable.", 
                "Is Grand Theft Auto V the best game of the year? Easily. Is it the best game of this current generation of consoles? Definitely – and it’s quite possibly the best video game yet. I say this after playing it for “only” 20 hours.", 
                "No one makes worlds like Rockstar, but at last it has produced one without compromise. Everything works. It has mechanics good enough to anchor games of their own, and a story that is not only what GTA has always wanted to tell but also fits the way people have always played it. It’s a remarkable achievement, a peerless marriage of world design, storytelling and mechanics that pushes these ageing consoles to the limit and makes it all look easy.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best sandboxes that video games have to offer. Where massive worlds often are plagued by boring missions and lifeless areas, Rockstar has managed to make an incredibly engaging game that still retains a humongous and lively world.", 
                "The writing associated with those main characters and their stories is the best part of Grand Theft Auto V.", 
                "There’s no better time than this to use the word masterwork: Rockstar did a colossal job creating a huge, visually stunning world chiseled in its finest details, populated by brilliant characters and with highly spectacular and varied gameplay.", 
                "No game can match its mix of scale, direction and quality - and we don't know when one might. [Dec 2013, p.52]", 
                "The world of Grand Theft Auto V is undeniably a masterpiece and has set a very high bar for sandbox gaming not only for this generation but for the next gen which is so closely upon us. Beyond the game’s story line you’ll be able to put in hundreds of hours just wandering the city streets and never be bored doing so.", 
                "Rockstar Games has managed to exceed my expectations and create one of the best games of this generation.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto 5 defines what we want out of a free-roam action game. It also outshines all of its predecessors in every possible way, because it perfects the familiar formula and takes it to new heights.", 
                "For the anarchist, GTA5 is quite a playground. The entire map is available once you get through an hour or so of the story, and the tools of destruction are numerous and hugely enjoyable, although some of them might need to be unlocked first. The Gatling gun returns and a gas canister spills a solid line of flammable justice waiting to be set off. Guns can be painted up and modded with flashlights, grips, scopes, and suppressors.", 
                "The standout factor for Grand Theft Auto V is that each character not only offers a unique perspective on the GTA world in which you’re taking part, but on gaming as a whole. Franklin is new to the ‘game’ -- he looks sharp and listens and learns. Michael is as I’ve painted him to be: a reluctant master in an ever-changing dojo clinging to a wall of arbitrary yet important-to-him trophies, while Trevor is the wild side in every gamer (thanks Joab) -- the sort of yes-man we inevitably become because pain and reward exist on a blurred precipice in modern narrative-driven gaming.", 
                "The narrative fails to match the impact John Marston or Niko Bellic's tales, but the colorful characters kept me interested in the story nonetheless. Like the golden state it parodies, Grand Theft Auto V is filled with beautiful scenery, a wealth of activities, and the promise of fortune.", 
                "GTA V continues the game series' tradition of raising the bar for open world action games.", 
                "Tons of gameplay hours, plenty of missions and activities with an awesome collection of vehicles of various modes of transportation and a large array of firearms put the grandeur once again into Grand Theft Auto.", 
                "GTA5’s main single player story mode delivers the best Grand Theft Auto experience to date.", 
                "Even a die-hard detractor of the Grand Theft Auto series (yes, that's me) is forced to admit that \"V\" is one sweet game. In fact, it's one of the best of this generation. [Oct 2013]", 
                "I can’t imagine the pressure behind the scenes, but everything that Rockstar has attempted with Grand Theft Auto V gels together perfectly. As we look forward to the next-generation launches in just a few months, it’s pretty awesome to see the best game of this entire generation cap it off.", 
                "Rockstar has expanded and improved upon so much of what's special about video games as mainstream spectacles, from the playful use of characters to the refined take on world design. The developer's progress makes the aspects of the game left in cultural stasis — the poorly drawn women, the empty cynicism, the unnecessarily excessive cruelty — especially agitating.", 
                "The most amazing thing about this criminal saga is not only its scale, but that it perfectly works on several levels. Spine-tingling driving, fun missions, excellent dialogue, fully fleshed characters, vicious satire on pretty much everything… One play-through is not enough to appreciate GTA 5 in all its multi-layered glory.", 
                "Its problems range from finicky little things like twitchy helicopter flying controls to much larger issues, such as unsettling bits of cruelty that don’t always register as satire, or the still-unsolved challenge of maintaining any sense of plot urgency in a game where players are free to abandon the storyline and spend hours skyjacking blimps, tooling around in a submarine or taking in-game smartphone selfies and posting them online.", 
                "Despite all these accomplishments and additions though, GTA V isn’t a huge leap forward for Rockstar. Instead, it’s an evolution of all their previous work, all combined into one sandbox experience on a massive scale. But it’s a satisfying path that the franchise has taken, kicking other genre games off the throne that it helped build.", 
                "Although it does suffer from a few problems that have plagued the franchise since the beginning, the improved driving controls, captivating leads, and the sprawling city of Los Santos should win the hearts of any open world fan out there.", 
                "An ambitious game, attempting to meld three very different characters together to tell one encompassing story of survival in what amounts to the worst place in America. That story stumbles, but the open-ended gameplay remains a showpiece for the vast amount of content that can be poured into a virtual world.", 
                "All three characters, in their respective ways, feel representative of the Grand Theft Auto series as a whole, and contribute to making GTA V what it is -- the ultimate culmination of Rockstar's beloved and despised series.", 
                "When you’re dealing with disturbing subjects ranging from life-destroying drug addiction to creepy cult organizations to legitimately psychopathic behaviour, the jokes go down a little easier if you get the sense that the writers penned their quips with an aim to make you think about why you’re laughing...True satire happens in Grand Theft Auto V, just not nearly as often as I’d like.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V offers one of the best sandbox experiences ever,\r\nfilled to the brink with stuff to do. The vistas are magnificent and\r\namazing stuff just seems to happen wherever you go. But at the same\r\ntime the story is tired and the characters unoriginal. Your\r\nappreciation of Grand Theft Auto V will depend of what you want out of\r\nthe series. The freedom and joy of discovery is hard to beat but\r\nthe rest still has some ways left to go.", 
                "Even with as many downs as ups, Grand Theft Auto V is still a significant achievement in design. Playing missions from multiple perspectives is a creative spark that will surely light up the next generation, and I'm confident the Housers have even bigger ambitions. They'll keep building upon this template and inch tantalizingly closer to creating their perfect game. GTA5 isn't it, but its flashes of brilliance will endure."

Shut up and let us enjoy our 360s and PS3s for once without you  all over yourselves). That said, this is also one of the few times I'd give a game a perfect score: there is so much to do in this game, there is so much detail in this world and every single object in it (buildings, cars, people, the writing; it just goes on), and I've yet to find a single activity that I haven't enjoyed (aside from a slightly annoying GPS and menu system). Is for mature audiences? Yes. Is  used so often in conversation that white people are going to have to retrain themselves for when it's acceptable to use that word? OH yes. Is it also something that demands your respect, and that you can tell Rockstar poured their souls into making it as good as possible?  YES. And with GTA Online coming two weeks from the original release (and time of writing), I highly doubt that gamers are going to stop talking about this anytime soon.… Expand",

Im not bashing the ps3 but there has been a confirmed texture glitch on ps3.\r Ive only had to load a few times the whole time ive played the game once when I installed the game and once when you load your saves, there is NO LOAD TIMES BETWEEN, BEFORE OR AFTER CUTSCENES and who ever says that is lying about it. There are load times between character switching but the switching was faster than loading a mutiplayer map on an FPS.\r The city is bigger than liberty city it feels even bigger than the Orignal Los santos we say in gta san. If someone is telling you that the city is \"small\" and \"not as big as the other cities\" is lying to you. I know this because the first time I saw the map I thought the city looked small myself when I got there I clearly saw I was wrong.  Ive been playing for 10 hours now and I still havent seen all the city or even touched the wilderness areas.\rThere isnt much to say about the graphics, there are a lot more effects and sun flares, the game looks better, the cars look better, everything just looks better.\r There are some bad things though...I did have a major frame rate drop while I was playing, It happened once but It was HORRIABLE, I dropped down to what felt like less than 10 frames for no reason what so ever. also if you look at the shadows too closely you can clearly see choppy and distorted shadows.\r Gameplay; The game play in this game feels....ok I guess, it isnt max payne which a lot of us were hoping for but it does get the job done, driving feels great.....shooting on the other hand just doesnt feel like it has the beefy impacts as gtaiv or max payne or even red dead have, but this doesnt effect scores since that is just a cosmetic effect.  Another problem I have about the game play is the specials each character gets; Micheal can slow down time while shooting max payne style, frank can slow down time while driving which also allows him to handle better and trevor can deal more damage while taking less., but the thing is Micheals just doesnt work or feel good it slows down time but it also slows you so much it doesnt even matter. Trevors is just hard to notice. But frank on the other hand feels good yet overpowered because of one thing, Frank can slow down time while in a car which means if hes doing drive bys he gets THE SAME EFFECT AS MICHEAL JUST IN A CAR! so basically frank gets two benefits while the others only get one.\r This game is not for everyone, If you dont like open worlds which have dense cities and open country sides you will not like this game, this game is a lot of driving and a lot of story which your average fps fan would not care for.   Me personally I love the game, I love its openness I love the look and its just nice to see a new gta game, It also *SLIGHT SPOILER*  has some pretty wacky moments that compare with saints row. but the thing is you have to know where to go to see these and you have to be willing to explore and find stuff your self and not be afraid of what might happen.\r A break down and final word: Graphics are nothing to worry about, Top notch graphics and only one major frame drop so far, which is great compared to other games this gen.\rGameplay is fun but no real learning curve.\rIm giving it a 10/10 just because the things I mentioned are not game breaking what so ever,...\r Oh and one last thing, people complaining about draw distance and the roads need to remember  that the city is based off of LA, A city which does have 6 lane super highways and smog so dense you cant see the horizen. and heres a little tip....   The game DOESNT have poor draw distance, its literally the smog just like in real LA. this smog doesnt show up at night or in the country side, so anyone who is saying the game has  draw distance clearly has never been to LA or seen real pictures besides the ones we see on TV of a clear clean LA.

After 5 years of waiting, we finally have the game we've all been waiting for.\r Grand Theft Auto has only been released today but it's got the whole world paying attention.\rAfter the minimal GTA IV, everyone has been eager for the next instalment to match up with GTA: San Andreas. The freedom that was available in San Andreas stayed in everyone's hearts and minds for all these years, and now it's back with style!\r The world is massive. When I say massive, I mean massive!\rThere were a lot of complaints from people when the map was leaked, saying that Los Santos is tiny and they were hoping for more. When you actually enter the world though, you finally see the epic scale of what Rockstar have created.\r Once you're on the road and doing your thing, the size doesn't even cross your mind because you're so involved with the game. Busting down roads in a sports car you've just stolen going at top speed still doesn't cover the map in any short time. That's not to mention Blaine County! The area is so huge and has so much to do there, you find yourself staying in the dirt county and enjoying the views and all the activities there is to do. It's great because Los Santos and Blaine County feel like totally different worlds, but you get to enjoy them in one solid game.\r I really enjoyed GTA: IV, because it felt fresh on the now current gen platforms. I always saw mixed reviews about the driving, but honestly, I loved it. It did take some time to adjust to the smooth, but loose handling of the cars, but after that it was just a barrel of fun.\rTo be honest though, I am glad that they have changed the mechanics of the handling on GTA V.\rWith the area been so big and varied, the sharper handling certainly does help out in some sticky situations. It's almost like they blended GTA: San Andreas & GTA: IV's handling and created something special. Sometimes it can feel like the handling is harsh, but once you get the hang of it, it certainly is something beautiful. Especially when you are on a mission and you have the police on your tail. This is where you get high end chases and everything flows perfect.\r So far I am really enjoying the story. It really feels like I'm in a interactive movie.\rThe scripting is done hilariously well. You want to know what the stories about and how they are going to come out on top. It really is great to see a well scripted story, but also a game that is so open and inviting, you feel drawn in and want to stay there. One minute you could be pulling off a major heist and the next you're riding your bike along the beach front watching the sun set.\r The gun play has greatly improved. If you are familiar with GTA: IV's controls for shooting then you'll be right at home here. It's a great mix of GTA and Max Payne 3, especially when you control Michael, as his special ability is slow motion. Yup, you read that right, each of the 3 characters has their own special ability. Michael has his slow motion for gun fights, Franklin has his slow motion focus with vehicles, which is great for getaways! And Trevor, who has a wicked rage ability. He inflicts extra damage on people, literally blowing their heads off! His damage is also reduced which really does help when you're in a rampage mood.\r There really is a enormous amount of content in this game. Something which is going to be absolutely amazing when GTA: Online is released on the 1st October.\r If you're looking for a new open world game to play, that offers the most amount of content you've ever seen (And that's not including GTA: Online), and you're looking for a fun story that draws you in to what's going on in the world, then Grand Theft Auto V is the game for you.\rThe unpredictable world really has so much to offer. You could be planning to do one thing and then something pops up along the way and while you're doing that, something else starts to happen. It all feels organic. You don't feel like you're forcing yourself to do anything. You just kick back and let the game entertain you.\r I definitely urge any long time fan of the GTA series, or anyone who loves their open world/action games, hell, even sports games, to give this a go.\rThe amount of content and things to do is enough to keep everyone interested for a long time.\r This game will be getting a 10/10 from me! The fact it made me want to write my very first review, shows me this game is special.

                "Sure, the controversy is attractive, but Vice City provides a perfect balance between an open-ended game that rewards players for exploring the environment without restrictions, while also handing out specific goals in order to complete the game. Not very many titles strike this balance so succinctly.",

                "On top of the fine sound effects and voice acting is a soundtrack that's beyond amazing.", 
                "In essence, Vice City is little more than a GTA3 expansion pack.  Still, considering this could have just been a cash cow license like Tomb Raider, Vice City came out surprisingly well.",

                "The weapons targeting system while on foot has gotten a significant upgrade from last years abysmal attempt, however targeting specific people in groups can still be problematic. Also the camera can be a bit confusing while running indoors. Overall, though, GTA:VC is a joy to play.", 
                "The seamless amalgamation of all things '80s into the mix lets the creative team go wild with the vocal work and provide an outstanding retro soundtrack.", 
                "It’s graphics notwithstanding, this is THE PS2 title XBox and GameCube loyalists will jealously write angrily about to Santa in their Christmas letters.", 
                "Every bit as good as we thought it would be – if not better... But don’t expect to be constantly surprised, for much of Vice City is a retread of old ground, and if you didn’t like the last one, then Vice City probably won’t change your mind.", 
                "It has the right blend of intense gameplay, an intricate place to explore, several hours of gameplay, a great selection of 80’s era music, a wonderful (if not a little cliched) story, and one of the most memorable antiheroes to ever set foot on the gaming scene.", 
                "To me, GTA:VC is same old, same old. Nothing about it screams out to me. Everything I need for any GTA addiction would be found in GTA III. Vice City just takes that title, polishes it and chucks in an 80's theme.", 
                "It's a game worth owning, for most, but it's not so revolutionary that it will make converts out of the skeptical. Perhaps in Grand Theft Auto 4. Time will tell.", 
                "I can't say it's perfect, though, as these models are somewhat archaic (especially for the chicas) by hey, they need something to shoot for. Maybe next time they'll give us a crack at it before \"Entertainment Weekly.\" [Jan 2003, p.79]", 
                "The maturation process of the series, and videogames, remain standstill because of the developer’s refusal to move outside racial and social stereotypes, and staying away from certain taboos of popular art, merely suggesting sex and drug use. Compared to what this game could’ve been, this is still kid’s gloves."

The only complement I have to give to this game is for the music. Worst combat I've ever tried in a video game, honestly. In addition it consists of terrible camera angles, if there's a guy next to you, you have to start looking around in first person like a moron, because the aim-assist doesn't work from where the camera is placed at any given time. What does it depend on then you ask? The direction the character is facing, which is ridiculous. Which brings me to my next complaint. Why did they bind the aiming to the left analog stick with the rifles, making only the aim-assist weapons like the shotgun bearable, was it their goal to make the controllers dramatically different in comparison to every other game in the world to make it a challenge for all the wrong reasons? I can handle a challenge, but not because of bad controls, that's completely the wrong way to go about it. And the pacing isn't very good either, games should be about applying what you've learned so far as you gradually become better, which is not present here, it's all about successfully bypassing the randomness that is the city. Graphics were superior in GTA 3. the missions feel like doing chores, and honestly I couldn't care less about the story - seems to me some wannabe gangster story for teenagers. You will also find your imminent death right around the corner just because your car happens to flip over, or a cop comes around the corner. Speaking of cops, they are the most aggressive police force in history, if you get stuck with your car you can bet your ass they are going to drive into it in full speed, resulting in it flipping upside down starting to burn immediately, or you can even try running in an attempt to seek for a new car only to find that the only cars are police ones. Unless of course you happen to be close to a Paint Garage where they are watching you from the outside, showing how little emphasis has been put on realism. I recently played Mass Effect 1 which is known to have an inferior combat system to the sequel, but it is nothing compared to this. I can't go past 2 missions without wanting to throw the controller at my brand new TV. Even when I get a Mission Accomplished screen I don't feel like I've accomplished **** and it just so happened that during that particular attempt I didn't have a car hit me from the side when passing an intersection, or that for once the camera angle happened to be pointing at enemies and potential roadblocks. I'd like to meet this fella who came up with the idea to bind the right analog stick to first person scenery, what on earth was he thinking. Trying to go into a alleyway with this camera system is suicide, because you can't see what you're shooting at. I'm 27% into the story and this game is already giving me more headaches than playing through God of War, which is a harder game, but at least when you die you are able to blame yourself - it is not an experience comparable to the coincidental deaths in Vice City. The map is godawful and doesn't show what direction you're heading, which makes me realise this is an old game that hasn't aged very well. If you **** up a mission, most of your time will be spent afterwards doing the exact same thing over and over until you reach the last part of the mission again. It's a waste of time, just let me restart where the challenge starts, it's not a challenge driving to the mission so why would I want to do it all over again? The taxi waiting outside is intended to take care of this problem, but you still have to enter the mission, and then drive to wherever you have to go, leading to myself wasting enormous amounts of spare time. I'm currently stuck on a mission because I didn't run back and save after every successful mission, leading to my character losing his weapons every now and then, and me having to repurchase them. Now I can't afford the properties to move on past mission V, which the game made no effort to inform me of, and I'm left with options like having to drive around in cab to collect hundreds of thousand dollars, which unfortunately is something I'm not willing to do on my spare time. Rockstar's concepts with this game was something along the lines of: Here's a timer for 15 minutes, I see you happened to get the first 14 minutes right and you are now driving over a bridge, we programmed this sequence so that the driver in the opposite lane will now switch lanes so that your car flips through the air and into the water - leading you to die a slow and painful death. We made this decision because lacking remorse, and feel that you should have to play all our missions at least twice, just to make the game appear longer and more \"hardcore\".… Expand",

                "With this latest version, Rockstar’s latest game is no longer just a masterpiece. It’s now a state-of-the-art technical marvel. On many levels, you haven’t seen what videogames can accomplish until you’ve played this version Grand Theft Auto V.", 
                "GTA V on PS4 does exactly what gamers everywhere have begged for since the PS3 iteration broke the industry. It provides you with an unprecedented level of freedom, then makes your eyes weep at how pretty it looks when you make the most of it . If you haven’t been introduced to Michael, Trevor and Franklin, then frankly we don’t know what on earth you were doing last year, but now is the perfect time to jump on board. It makes one of the medium’s best games even better. [January 2015, p70]", 
                "Another rampage through Los Santos in the eyes of your character, rather than looking over his shoulder, is both a surprising and surprisingly impressive feature that adds a lot of value.", 
                "GTA 5 is still one of the best games money can buy and with the added features of the latest edition, it is worth upgrading your last gen copy.", 
                "This is how you do a next-gen remaster. Rockstar has pulled out all the stops to bring GTA V up to speed on PS4 and Xbox One. Beautiful, immersive, essential - it begs to be played all over again.", 
                "One of the best games of all time became even better. You should try this new-gen edition of GTA V even if by now you know Los Santos like the back of your hand.", 
                "A beautiful, expertly realised world.", 
                "After only a few hours of playing I knew everything I needed to write this review and I kept playing. GTA V is a master class of gaming, an explosion of ideas and details that will amaze everyone. You could have travelled across the entire game world and I'm sure, you haven't seen everything this game has to offer. Rockstar keeps surprising but right now does it in Full HD and with lots of cool new features.", 
                "If you held out this long to play Grand Theft Auto V, wait no longer. I wouldn’t call this a “definitive” version, but it is damn near close.", 
                "The bar has been raised...Good luck reaching it, let alone clearing it.", 
                "The first-person camera mode does more than change the flow and feeling of play. In Grand Theft Auto V on PS4, every movement and action carries more excitement and meaning. Alongside visual upgrades and content additions, this version of Rockstar's masterpiece is can't-miss gaming.", 
                "The single player GTAV experience is so fulfilling that I didn’t expect to ever really get involved much with GTA Online. It didn’t take much to suck me in though, and it can be an addictive and fun time waster depending on who you roll with. I’ve spent a fair share of time online, and although it’s been slightly shaky here and there, nearly everything that Rockstar Games has promised is more or less working.", 
                "Its world is a truly astonishing achievement in so many ways, and these two versions are currently the best way to experience it, aside from the hobbled multiplayer matchmaking.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V really surprised me. For a series I have had very little interest in the past outside an appreciate for technical proficiency, I found myself drawn into a world where lots of bad things happen to a good number of people - and I was often the one perpetrating these crimes. Call it self-aware social criticism or a guilty pleasure, Grand Theft Auto V proves to be a great deal of fun.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V for new-gen is without a doubt the best way to experience one of the biggest releases of the last half decade.", 
                "The best version (so far) of one of last-gen's finest games, GTA 5's remaster is testament to how much difference a graphical overhaul can make, even just a year after release.", 
                "GTA V is Rockstar's midlife crisis: hostile, extravagant, but ultimately revealing a fascinating depth of self-loathing.", 
                "This is the definitive version of one of the finest games of the last few years, and one that better lives up to Rockstar's lofty ambitions.", 
                "For most, Grand Theft Auto V and GTA Online will continue to present the same frustrations in place of freedom. There’s no getting around the fact that this open-world game aims to deliver variety, largely does, and yet still steps on a few toes and the sensibilities of responsibly minded Americans. I can’t help but love the parody and the ensuing outcry.", 
                "Rockstar came, saw and conquered in 2013 and does exactly the same in 2014. So our grade for GTA V stands.", 
                "Not only does GTA V on PS4 and Xbox One set a new benchmark for HD remakes, it's also a challenge to the games originally made for this new generation.", 
                "It's more of the same? Yes. But it's also better, much better. GTA5 is as great as it was last year, and this version has lots of small changes - or big ones, like the first person camera - that make the experience even more enjoyable.", 
                "The best version of one of the best games of the past generation. With lots of added details, new content, updated graphics and an interesting (albeit not perfect) first-person view, this is hands down the GTA V we'll give to the history books.", 
                "More than just a gimmick, the first-person mode really does change how it’s experienced by adding a new layer of gameplay. It won’t be for everybody, but the sheer fact that the option is there is commendable. More still, multiple new vehicles, weapons and animals have been introduced. If none of that were enough, over a hundred new songs have been added to the already robust radio stations.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V shows how to bring a PS3 title to the PS4 the right way. With a vastly improved open-world containing more traffic density, pedestrians and better graphics. GTA V is among the most beautiful games available on the PS4. Innovation is key with GTA V, with not only the three protagonists, but now also the addition of a very well done first-person mode.", 
                "A masterpiece among the best of them, GTA 5 is out on next gen consoles in an improved version, and it is hardly believable. Vastly improved graphics, a good use of the Dualshock 4's features and the FPS viewpoint make this version a contender for the hall of fame.", 
                "Rockstar did it again. Not only is this new version of Grand Theft Auto V much prettier than the original version, it is also offers a new and convincing first person mode. Truly unmissable.", 
                "GTA V represents the videogame at its finest. Tense and dramatic when it wants, joyful and surprising when the player wants it. Rockstar has managed to harmonize the different trends in the saga, managing to create an unforgettable experience that will be enjoyed for a long time to come. This new version comes with some interesting additions: FPS mode, new events and challenges and big GTA online seasons.", 
                "Anyone concerned that this was just another money-spinning “definitive edition” can rest easy. As ever, Rockstar don’t do things by halves, and Grand Theft Auto V on PS4 feels truly next-gen. It’s not just a remake, it’s a testament to the quality of the original that GTA V can effortlessly stand among the best titles so far available on the new consoles and, in many cases, surpass them.", 
                "An incredibly ambitious upgrade that not only improves the visuals and gameplay but, through the new first person view, offers a new way to play the best GTA ever.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto 5 has never been so nice to see and smooth to play: this new version is a further proof of the fine work that Rockstar infuses in every game.", 
                "I can’t stress just how much fun it is to experience Grand Theft Auto V again from a new perspective. The impact it has on the series is huge, but is somewhat muted from it debuting in a re-release and not a new entry in the series. I went into this review expecting to play the same game again, and I did, but Rockstar made it feel new.", 
                "The visual upgrade to Grand Theft Auto V on the current generation systems would be enough to warrant a re-purchase. It’s absolutely stunning and by far one of the best looking games on current gen. The additional online content, modes, cars, people and the inclusion first-person is just icing on the cake.", 
                "It’s more than just a great game, it’s damn near perfect, and I don’t say that about many games. The attention to detail Rockstar has put into this new version is above and beyond what we are used to getting and set a new bar for all other developers out there wanting to re-release a great title on next-gen platforms.", 
                "The first-person perspective manages to make a year-old game feel new again, and the changes made to the graphics, gameplay and online mode are substantial. One of 2013's best games is made even better on the PlayStation 4.", 
                "The definitive version of what is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. It's worth reliving. [Feb 2015, p.58]", 
                "Truly spectacular, and certainly worth buying and playing again. [Issue#251, p.64]", 
                "This is one of the best games ever constructed and yeah, it just got better.", 
                "Everything’s better and bigger in this next-gen version of GTA V. And the first person view is something extremely fun to experience in multiplayer.", 
                "If you didn't play GTA V on PS3/Xbox 360, don't think, just play it. If you have played GTA V on PS3/Xbox 360, again don't think, just play it. Because San Andreas calls all of us once again.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V jumps into the next gen to also become the best current game. It is inevitable to see technical aspects belonging to the old gen, but it doesn't burden the work Rockstar made in this remaster, which is outstanding. There are reasons to go back to Los Santos, this time with PS4.", 
                "Rockstar's masterpiece is better than ever. It's up to you to decide whether it's worth your time and money if you've already played it, but if you haven't, we can tell you it is.", 
                "An incredible remaster. Graphics gain more quality and polish, and the first person view is a good enough reason to play it all over again.", 
                "Rockstar demonstrates one more time that they don't make things like the others. GTA V for next-gen is another big example, the best way to experience the fantastic story of Michael, Franklin and Trevor.", 
                "The impressive GTA V has extra impact now that it has landed on next gen consoles. The locations in the game have always been eye candy and the visual upgrade offers even more depth. The first person mode is a spectacular addition.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V for the next generation consoles is the best Grand Theft Auto game ever released. [Dec 2014]", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V isn’t exactly a next gen masterpiece but it is undeniably the undisputed king of open world games.", 
                "It’s funny, well written, good looking, has great music and will keep you busy for months. It is an essential purchase for those who haven’t played it before and a huge recommendation for those who have.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto 5 is not perfect, but it is so advanced and so impressive that is easily confused with a game developed from scratch for the new generation.", 
                "Rockstar manages to make a massive game even more massive and\r\nlikeable. The new first person mode offers a completely unique way of\r\nexperiencing the game, which together with 1080p and other graphical\r\nupgrades makes this recommendable to both new and returning customers\r\nalike.", 
                "New modes, new ideas and a sleeker multiplayer side that makes GTA V one of the games out there that is worth replaying. Welcome back to Los Santos, the city of opportunity.", 
                "Los Santos feels more alive than ever, and whether you're a frequent visitor or not, we'd recommend booking a seat on the next-gen flight if you haven't already.", 
                "A first person view, 1080p, a new weather and lighting system and a ton of additional content will add up to one of the most complete gaming experiences of the last years.", 
                "Grand Theft Auto V for the PlayStation 4 is easily the best version of the game available at the moment. At the end of the day, it is still functionally the same game as before, with most of the same flaws and strengths.", 
                "The renovation of Grand Theft Auto V is a success. The game looks great on the new consoles and from the new first person viewpoint it also feels different.", 
                "A spit-shined re-release of one of the most ambitious games of last generation is nothing to be flip about, especially with just how polished this version feels.", 
                "If you’re like me and spent an exorbitant amount of time with the game already, you may find that the new content will keep you busy for a some time, but ultimately it will be a trip down memory lane more than a new lease on life.", 
                "I loved it back then, and I love it now. Its attempts at clever humor can be embarrassingly misjudged, its content is often alarming, and I think those who point out the game’s problematic elements are perfectly within their right to do so, and they’re very rarely wrong. Still, I can accept that the game is troubling while still enjoying it, and the extensive augmentations found within the PS4/Xbox One version makes it all the more pleasant.", 
                "The best game of 2013 is fine tuned and improved with more content on the next gen consoles. The first person mode is a fun and awesome experience, but in action moments it sometimes chokes a bit.", 
                "While the narrative leaves a bit to be desired, Grand Theft Auto V on the PlayStation 4 is a technical marvel, a masterclass in world building, and absolutely worth exploring again.", 
                "With the new power, the developer has added more depth and life to the world of Los Santos. It's the same game, but the new visual effects and first-person mode provides a strong experience. It's not completely worth a double-dip if you tore through the original GTA V, but it's definitely worth a second look.", 
                "With all the tweaks and additions, the current generation edition is unquestionably the best. It may not include quite enough fresh content to warrant a second purchase, but it’s certainly the edition that ought to be sought out by those yet to play...Most importantly, perhaps, it provides us with a small peephole into the future of the series.", 
                "Aside from a few mild frame rate issues that sometimes take the edge off its more dramatic moments, this is the definitive version of GTA V, and the bar by which all other open-world games, or indeed any game that aims for a cinematic feel, should be judged. It is beautiful, and thought-provoking, and thrilling throughout."

So one gets the feeling being excluded from the game and restricted to the role of the audience.\rLos Santos is very small compared to it's predecessor. And the streets are limited by heaps of signs and barriers. While driving one gets the sensation of staying in a cage, like in a hamster wheel.\rUnfortunately there is only this one small city and some negligible estates. The whole map is encircled within less than a quarter of an hour. The countryside doesn't offer much.\rSo all in all GTA V lacks the possibility to merge with the game. There is no way to develop your character.\rThese 3 shallow guys have nothing like-able, the family of Michael is disgusting, Franklin boring, Trevor a psychopath.\rThere are no restaurants like before, no gyms, no girlfriends, nearly no secrets to discover. Golf and Yoga is a bad joke. To value a game just by it's graphics would be too narrowly considered.

The classic signs of stardom in Los Santos, the likable and realism of the characters and the many hidden secrets behind this twisted city of  poor decisions have made this one a winner. Rockstar does it again. The same basic concept of a 3rd person shooter and driving with twists of filthy humor but lighthearted (to an extent) content mixed in with conspiracy theories will make any gamer cringe and shake with pleasure. An amazing game doesn't come without its great artistic integrity.

Voice acting is top notch, some scenes are hilarious. The story is just OK, though. Some missions did feel a bit disjointed. And I didn't really like the characters that much. They're all nuts. I guess Michael is supposed to be the straight(est) man, but even he's a bit much. Characters rant and yell at each other often, it got annoying at times.\r The biggest problem with the single player is the lack of variety in missions. After San Andreas the series started taking mission types away, which I hated. GTA5 changes things up but the missions still feel a bit underdeveloped. In fact, the entire single player campaign feels kind of underdeveloped. Unique mission types seem a bit too rare and are over with fairly quick. What about buying and selling drugs? I loved that in Chinatown wars. My main complain then is that Rockstar should've brought more elements from previous GTA games and elaborated on them. There're too many standard fare driving missions. Also, money never seemed to be an issue. By the time I got a plane to do money missions it didn't matter, the game was almost over anyways. Add or add more missions in which you use all three characters, fly a jet, jetpack, gathering a posse, buy/sell drugs. And early in the game when money is actually tight. And THEN you work the story in. Story revolves around gameplay, not the other way around!\r Of course, their focus now is on multiplayer which is total b.s. I'm not crazy about multiplayer and I sure as hell don't want to play with moronic teenagers. After you pass the game there's little to care about other than multiplayer if you're a teenager. There isn't much hope that GTA or any rockstar game's single player experience will be very evolutionary. It's to be seen if Red Dead Redemption 2's single player will actually be as good or better than the first. Rockstar seems content on being a company that just makes MMO's.

From the gorgeous (but not 60 fps) setting to the well crafted and detailed new story and world, from the robust and varied multiplayer mode, this game is a must-have for every console gamer.\r 1. The Story: I love the switching between the three major characters, Michael, Trever, And Franklin. Each one has their own unique story, and in making the story follow each character, all the missions are fun and varied (except for a few duds revolving around a pier) and I actually played a few over again to try and get all gold missions. The heists are by far the best part of the single player mode, and in multiplayer s well! The side missions are fun as well, and there's so many activities, like golfing or racing, that you can get lost in the game, which is something all good games should aim for. While not as good as Red Dead Redemptions story, this is definitely one of the best Open World stories in a while.\r 2. The Setting: Los Santos is by far the most expansive and diverse world ever created in video games. The insane detail is put in every part of the map, and the game is just so beautifully realized. Having spent most of my life living in LA, its insane how much effort Rockstar went to create a video game form of it. From the depths of the ocean, with orcas and dolphins and kelp forests, to the awesome and realistic vehicles, to every part of the map, this setting is amazing. If GTA 4's Liberty City felt like a living city, GTA 5's Los Santos feels like a living WORLD. And the in game radio stations are fantastic as well.\r 3. Multiplayer: While I see multiplayer as a bonus, many people skip single player altogether to go play with their buddies, which is understandable. Starting off, the much-improved character creation finally makes your characters just like how you want them, unlike its PS3 and 360 counterparts. Again, everything about it is excellent, the game challenges you to level up and unlock new guns, or you can just go and create havoc and start wars with friends or strangers, or skydive with twelve of tour friends and try to land in a swimming pool. The possibilities are endless. The heists are an amazing new addition, and the monthly updates are great. There are many connection issues that spoil multiplayer quite a bit, but its a fun experience nonetheless.\r So that's my full review. Almost everything about the game is spot on and perfect, the first person setting is tons of fun, the single player is great, the multiplayer is great, Trevor is great, everything's great. If you don't have this, Get it. NOW!!!!!!… Expand", 
                "I'm not really sure where to begin with a game like Grand Theft Auto 5. To say it's a masterpiece is an understatement, if anything.

To say it's a masterpiece is an understatement, if anything. The story is incredibly well written, the game looks absolutely amazing, and it plays like a dream. The world is incredibly open and immersive, with so many things to do, see, and experience, and it easily makes this one of the best games I think I have ever played.\r I'd say that the biggest component of this game would easily be the single player story mode. Unlike other Grand Theft Auto games, where you would play a single character throughout the game mode, Grand Theft Auto V differs in the fact that you're able to play one of 3 different characters (An upper class ex-con by the name of Michael, a gang member living in the slums of Los Santos going by the name of Franklin, and a drug and gun runner by the name of Trevor) and you get to play through the story of how they killed a lot of people, made a lot of money, and made a lot of enemies. It sounds like a weird concept to start off with, but this helps to increase the immersivity immensely, as you've got several characters weaving around the story and changing from and because of it.\r Another thing to help immerse the player even further is the amount of detail that was put into every part of the world. Not just in terms of graphics, but almost everything that comprises the world. Every single radio station has its specific set of hosts, every car has its specific way that it handles, and with the addition of the new First Person mechanic (which is a little iffy, in all honesty) adds a whole new level to that. You can see the radio station in the car, you can see your character pull up his cell phone whenever you use it, you can see your character flip the bird whilst driving down the highway, and it helps to further how much you are being put into this world. There are even phone numbers for various people within the world (celebrities, realtors, just about anyone and everyone) which you can actually call and interact with. You can go to a myriad of different websites and use them as though they were a real site (my personal favorite is the Republican Space Rangers website, which contains an actual 30 minute long cartoon). It's one thing to talk about how a game plays and whether or not you like the characters, but the amount of painstaking detail in this game alone is making me enjoy it even more.\r Another good thing about the game is that you can see how your actions affect the world around you, in some way or another. There's a mission in the campaign where Michael ends up destroying a house, and the house will still be there, utterly destroyed. Missions where Franklin carries out hits for another main character in the game, Lester show effects in terms of news articles detailing how the person was recently found dead. Not only that, but these hits also affect the stock price of whichever company the person was in charge of. That's right, a freaking stock market! There's one for the single player mode, and another that's controlled real-time by members of Rockstar's Social Club.\r Considering that the majority of people playing this game are more than likely to be young adults, I think it works perfectly. There are a lot of references to and parodies of events that are happening every day, all around us. Whether it's highlighting corruption in the higher ups of the police force (the FIB and the IAA doing unspeakable things to get more money for their departments) or a jab at the recent controversy with police and race relations (some cars have 'Obey and Survive' put on the side of their car, Franklin gets targeted by police more than his Caucasian counterparts, etc.). It provides an interesting, sometimes comedic and sometimes insanely dark look into the world around us. Sometimes it provides a more political statement (the race relations, drug legalization, so on) and other times it's the same old Grand Theft Auto, in which you steal cars, blow some stuff up, and go to a strip club.\r To say that this game is a masterpiece is an understatement, and if I'm being completely honest it's without a doubt one of, if not THE best game I have ever played.… Expand",

I can definitely say I'm glad I waited.\r Now, by not having played the last-gen GTA 5, I can't really compare the graphics too much. There are plenty of image and video comparisons out there. And from what I've seen, the overhaul seems quite extensive. At any rate, the game is gorgeous on PS4. There are times when I'm walking around that I find myself stopping because of how real everything looks. I can't imagine what PC modders will do with their version when it releases. I imagine near photo-realistic if not photo-realistic fidelity. Rockstar says the game is locked at 30fps but there are definitely a few hiccups. It's definitely not Unity-bad by any means, but high speed chases/racing and traffic clutter and explosions can cause a few frames to drop. Most of the time, though, it is a pretty consistent 30fps. Think Assassin's Creed: Black Flag consistency.\r At first, the thought of juggling three main characters in one story seemed overwhelming. But after playing for a few hours and realizing how seamless it was to jump between them all, I'm glad they made this decision instead of going into separate DLC chapters in the vein of GTA 4. The story itself is amazing, but I wasn't surprised. Rockstar has a reputation by now, and I didn't expect it to dwindle with GTA 5. The cutscenes, voice acting, and animation are all top notch. You know you have a riveting world and story when you're telling yourself \"just one more mission\" before bed to see what kind of crazy event is going to happen next. I find myself doing just that, much akin to my over zealous netflix tv show binges.\r The biggest pull for me, though (and I'm sure for many other people who had already played GTA 5 on last-gen consoles) is the first-person mode. When this feature was debuted, all I could think about was \"Oh my god, it's basically modern day Skyrim!\". And...it really is. The attention to detail on all of the animations and movement really sells it. It doesn't feel like GTA with first person. It feels like a completely different game. And I love that about it. I will say, however, that getting used to the sensitivity and controls in first-person mode requires a little patience. I suppose I'm spoiled by Destiny and Call of Duty at this point, but the aiming and movement in first-person feels floaty, and I still haven't completely nailed it down yet. Thankfully, sticky-targeting still works in this mode though. And I will probably just continue to rely on that.\r You're probably wondering why I'm scoring a 9 instead of a 10, given all the praise. Well, while the single-player I feel is near flawless, the GTA Online aspect is less than so. When GTA 5 was first released on last-gen consoles, I had heard about the GTA Online woes. The glitches, the crashing, and the long load times were just a few of the things people were complaining about, and it seems they have migrated over to this version as well. I, myself, experienced three instances of complete game freezing and two instances of network or disconnection errors just the other night. It can be frustrating, especially when the load times are so long. After the last error I ended up calling it a night, mostly because I didn't want to sit at the loading screen for another 10 minutes. When it does work, however, it works well. Lag is hardly ever an issue, and there is much to do and a lot of fun to be had while doing it. Rockstar just needs to get a bit more stability in place, and GTA Online (and GTA 5 as a whole) will be perfect.… Expand",

To be completely honestThis is my first review here on meta critic based on my first impressions of the game.  I have enjoyed what i have played so far of the Main story but switching between the characters interrupts the story and makes it less interesting and enjoyable to me especially when it forces me to play as characters I have no interest in to progress further in the story.  To be completely honest though the reason I gave this a bad review is almost entirely the online multiplayer aspect of the game.  GTA 5's Online game play is a joke when it even works!  Trying to play with an open server i suffered through constant network errors and disconnects until finally getting it to work somewhat reliably in a private game with some friends.   GTA V online is purely designed as a cheap cash grab gimmick.   it lets you steal and test drive any available car in the game but if you want to permanently own most of the nicer more expensive cars you have to spend large sums of in game money to purchase them from a web app on your in game phone.  In order to make the money you can do in game missions which take you to separate instances away from the main online server OR you can spend real money to buy in game cash.  If you find a really nice car you like driving and you load into a mission instance the car disappears and you have to go find it again elsewhere which i suspect is an intentional aspect of the game to trick people into spending more real money so they can keep the car without loosing it.  If you think about it the sole purpose of the missions is to grind for money so that you can buy  the cars in the game so spending real money to buy the cars defeats the purpose of playing the online multiplayer at all.  The missions instances employ unnecessary and annoying loading screens and menu navigation.  The last GTA game i played and enjoyed was San Andreas where you could do missions like Vigilante by just hopping in a police car and then driving around chasing down criminals.  I loved that, not this mission hub garbage.  In the 4-5 hour span of time i played i only tried one race mission but it didn't let me use my car, instead it forced me to use a preselected car for the race / track that was the same care the other people racing with me had to use.

It is not bad for gun fights or just walking around although there are some minor bugs that could be patched.  Driving cars on the other hand is nearly impossible.  There is little to almost no way of keeping the car somewhat on the road.  They should also make the side mirrors reflect everything behind you.

Let's talk about them now.\r 1. The wanted system: The wanted systems in GTA games has alwes had 6 wanted levels, this one just has 5... for some reason. In previous games you didn't get a wanted level everytime you steal a car. Hell, even if you stand near someone they'll call the cops! It doesn't make any sense!\r 2. The controls: The controls in GTA games haven't alwes been the best. But this takes it to the next level. How Rockstar managed to screw up the controls is beyond me. From simply walking on the street to flying a plane. The controls alwes manages to feel bad.\r 3. The open world: GTA has alwes had an impressive open world. From Vice City to San Andreas the maps were HUGE! This one is so small, you could drive around the entire map in maybe 10-15 minutes. Yet the developes keep saying GTA 5's map is bigger than the previous games. No, not at all.\r But hey, the game has free DLCs (Hows that singleplayer DLC coming along, Rockstar?), and first person.

The question is mainly if this is your first encounter with gta or if you already played the older games. In case its your first time, youll be amazed by the irony, the free world and all the rest - buy it. But if you know the older games theres pretty much no way you will enjoy the game for more than, say 30 hrs of gameplay. Singeplayer: The Characters are in some way cool but more like CSI guy cool - superficial, dumb, stilted. You wont ever care for them, especially for Franklin, hes plain boring and pointless. The story is okay in the beginning and than turns to extreme stupidity. I had more than one wtf and facepalm moment. The world in general is as said ok but not as good as the predecessors. What happend to car physics. You can now carry as many guns as you want, but as the guns are just upgrades you can throw away 20 of 30 guns (not literally). Most of the map is pointless nothing and the city offers less than ever. Side activities often lead to new hights of boredom. Like riding around in a slow submarine for hours or doing the easiest \"quick\" time events in yoga.\rNow to the multiplayer: You dont ever say anythhing but thats no problem as theres no story. Everyone looks almost the same and everyone will drive the same (the fastest) car. The missions are 90% kill/retrieve with alway the same cutscenes for certain questgivers. I personally disliked races a lot due to the horrible physics, graphics and the lack of speed. Even the bugatti feels very slow whilst the average traffic drives with nearly walking pace. Tdm and the story missions used to be my favourite aspects of the gta4 multiplayer. As said theres no story this time and due to bad mechanics tdm cant get quite as good. But this tdm is massive garbage. New players come to a game with 25% maxhealth and a pistol. On the other hand more advanced players can buy radar for ingame money and usually have the strongest rifles with unlimited ammo and additional silencers. WHAT THE **** this is in no way excuseable. The game is designed just around the idea of the player buying all the nice stuff ingame. But this is only possible through either playing this **** game for hundreds of hours or buying ingame money with real money. A good example for this that in free roam - usually the main playground in gta - you constantly burn money trough dying, destroing cars and shooting your ammo. Or simple clothing like a black shirt n trousers outfit priced at 50k. A 500k sharkcard is 10$. So 1$ for this one ulgy, pointless outfit out of like 30. A maximum tuned out top car costs about 2 mil. - thats 50$ for the 3,5 mil sharkcard. But hey you got 1,5 mil for other stuff. Likely the next update will just bring a better car wich you should buy then. Now lets make thia point more obvious on the military vehicles. You just bought the only attack heli in the game the \"buzzard\" for 1,75 mill (bout 25$), but its okay cause now youre the king in town... but the last update brought the 2 mill savage heli wich is much better.  Now theres even a jet for 3 mil and an amored car for over 1 mil. So you DEFINATELY would have to buy atleast one 99$ 8mil shark card to get the full gaming content. RIDICULOUS pay to win right here.

The game includes fun exercises like speedy calculations, change-making, and piano playing, but at some point, all of those little practices will get repetitive and you will likely drop your whole brain routine in maybe a month.  It's a shame, too, because the game does execute quite nicely.  I remember starting off with the brain of a 34-year-old to the brain of a 25-year-old, and I was 15 at that time.  The game persistently tracks your progress, and even the good doctor is quite encouraging (and very quirky).  Oh, and did I mention it has tons of sudoku puzzles to complete?  But here are the problems with the game: exercises involving text will eventually repeat itself at some point in time, making the minigame a chore, instead. By the way, don't believe the kid that has the syllable minigame world record.  He already knew what the answers were because he played it beforehand.  And that's another problem: usually, exercises not involving math will not only not be recorded after doing them a second time in a day, but they will also repeat itself, limiting the play time of the game. Also, after playing all of those games for days and keeping a solid brain workout routine, Brain Age 2 will eventually get repetitive, and you will drop routine after maybe a month.

It boasts better balancing and takes into account the supportive players more than ever compared to the regular solo guns blazing hero. Quite comprehensive, it also re-introduces the beloved Spec Ops mode, and the launch of Call of Duty Elite grants him the best available service in that category. Even though in terms of production values, and scope of the competitive multiplayer, Battlefield 3 harms Activision's champion, it remains a title that is firmly anchored to its traditional strengths, and doesn't get lazy. The lovers will be ecstatic, the haters gonna hate.",

MW3 absolutely delivers.",

It feels very safe, which is understandable given the budget and its sales expectations-as well as the rabid fan base that doesn't necessarily want innovation.",

It's a balancing act, and I don't think any gaming developer in their right mind would attempt to make an entirely new package here.", 
                "While the first two Modern Warfares proved to be the extraordinary work of a single, incredibly talented team, the third instalment in the series stands as a manifesto to what three great teams, working together as one passionate unit, can achieve. It's an improvement over its predecessor in pretty much every aspect and a return to former strength after the stagnation that was MW 2. Sledgehammer and Infinity Ward deliver a natural conclusion to an astounding trilogy - and the best Call of duty since the first Modern Warfare.", 
                "I'm glad to say the multiplayer remains addicting and is more balanced than ever.", 
                "Following in its predecessors footsteps, MW3 once again offers a great piece of entertainment. The campaign is short as usual, yet well-crafted, especially for the urban environments. Spec Ops, both Missions and Survivals, are a lot of fun, but the true heart of it all is in the competitive multiplayer. New modes and rebalanced perks and streaks add some teamwork-oriented action, and the overall experience is rich and entertaining as usual. It lacks in innovation, but it's still the best shooter on HD consoles.", 
                "A refinement of the series that further evidences why, year after year, Activision puts it on a pedestal. If you enjoy shooters, you owe it to yourself to at least give Modern Warfare a chance. If you've been on the fence because of the die-hards, this is the year to dip your toe in the water.", 
                "It delivers everything that you expect from a Call of Duty release, and it does that very well. The campaign strikes a perfect chord and there's not a single dull mission in the bunch, every minute filled with bravado and bravery as it steadily rises toward a thoroughly satisfying conclusion.", 
                "It's not often that a game franchise can be this good on such a consistent basis, but the Modern Warfare series continues to impress thanks in large part to its stellar story and highly-replayable multiplayer components.", 
                "Much like its predecessors in many ways, but bigger and more varied. The multiplayer mode got new kill streaks, new objectives and an extreme number of unlockable content. Add a solid (but almost to intensive) campaign, a survival mode and the spec ops missions and you got a seriously great game.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is the best package of it's kind on consoles and instead of going stale it continues to impress.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is a great FPS and a satisfying ending to Infinity's trilogy. With an adrenalinic and spectacular campaign and very entertaining multiplayer modes, fans of the series won't be disappointed – though we would have liked if the developers pushed it more on the technical side.", 
                "Much like its predecessors: a bombastic but brief single player campaign coupled with laser-focused multiplayer.", 
                "This is probably the best Modern Warfare ever published. The campaign is\r\nnot as fresh as we hoped, but every new touch in the multiplayer is\r\nindisputable.", 
                "Despite feeling some fatigue with the reuse of this same formula repeatedly, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 still winds up being everything I expected, and it even includes a few extra additions and improvements I didn't expect.", 
                "Everything fans may expect. A frantic and incredibly fun multiplayer with tons of options, game modes and unlockables, and also very well polished, and an intense campaign that concludes a story which started with Modern Warfare four years ago. The formula is aging - although it works as well as ever, its visuals are stagnating, but this is still a must-have for those looking for direct action.", 
                "In a single-player campaign that goes a bit over-the-top at times, it's a relief to see that the action is scaled-back with Soap and Price often enough to ensure that these characters receive the billing they deserve. Elsewhere in the multiplayer, Infinity Ward was always going to have a hard time replicating the impact of its package from two years ago but it's managed a rock-solid, if slightly conservative offering for this difficult third album in the Modern Warfare series.", 
                "If you're looking for a new kind of shooter, look elsewhere. Modern Warfare 3 succeeds by doing more – much, much, much more – of what's always worked spectacularly for the series. We still can't get enough.", 
                "Gameplay-wise, it's essentially the same game; that is, the best online FPS, an exciting and frantic experience. It offers several game modes, new weapons and balances the perks. Also, the competitive and the cooperative experience in Spec Ops and Survival has been greatly improved. And it has the best campaign yet in a Modern Warfare game. Another headshot from Infinity Ward.", 
                "As substantial as they are the changes won't silence committed critics, but for accessible, content-rich action this is still the best first person shooter of the year.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 doesn't do anything new, but it also doesn't do anything wrong. For better or worse, this is a slick and well-metered trio of modes that make an entertaining package, but Sledgehammer Games and Infinity Ward are simply looking to augment previous games rather than expand the series into pastures new.", 
                "Modern Warfare has always relied on smoke and mirrors. What surprises us is how ably the conjurers perform despite the much publicised Infinity Ward departures. After many months of doom-mongering it's great to find a game as confident and capable as those that preceded it.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is a solid FPS. If you didn't like the previous chapters, you won't change your mind, since the game doesn't change its formula. Scripted, spectacular and short, the single player campaign is just an appetizer, leading you to taste the savory multiplayer and the amazing Spec-Ops missions.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer is some of the series' strongest, and the co-op offerings have been expanded tenfold. But the campaign will leave you yearning, wishing that the characters were differentiated by more than thick accents, or that the gameplay tried something more than aim, shoot, take cover, reload, rinse and repeat.", 
                "Without question a better game than the previous three CoD games and easily the most spectacular in the series.", 
                "The multiplayer is hands-down the best it has ever been, with more features, more modes and a ton of new levels and ways to interact via Call of Duty Elite. The singleplayer campaign and Spec Ops mode add value to the overall package, creating something that may not be perfect, but is too damn addicting to pass up.", 
                "An emphatic, feature-packed and sometimes stunning final act.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 meets expectations. The core elements of multiplayer and the campaign remain fundamentally unchanged, but the game serves as a great example of how many subtle tweaks can add up to an improved overall product.", 
                "I never expected Modern Warfare 3 to go toe-to-toe with EA's juggernaut this year, but it came out of the gates with a tour de force campaign and co-op mode. It loses points with a perhaps too-familiar multiplayer that caters to the juvenile on Xbox Live; though don't be mistaken, Modern Warfare 3 is one hell of a shooter and a highlight for a series that just won't die – no matter how much we wish it bloody would, at times.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is a solid entry into the series. The singleplayer campaign offers non-stop action to the point of excess, while the multiplayer offers the usual hooks and unlockables that will keep you busy for weeks to come. [Nov 2011]", 
                "Largely feels like an iterative title...This isn't to say that Modern Warfare 3 is at all a bad game-it's an attractive and polished effort with tight controls, addictive multiplayer, and the sense that one is truly on a battlefield, rather than carrying on a miniature war behind the scenes.", 
                "In the end of it all Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 delivers the goods, though one wonders if even the ravenous fan base will be pleased for much longer unless we see a bit more revitalization in the franchise.", 
                "A great first person shooter, but at the same time a formula that starts to feel dated with this iteration. Modern Warfare 3 is an off-line spectacle and another splendid multiplayer game.", 
                "Ultimately, Modern Warfare 3 feels similar to it's brethren, but that doesn't mean it isn't a great game. The single player element is still exciting, and multiplayer has more options than ever – if you're a fan of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 is a no brainer.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 deserves a 10/10 in a 'Call of Duty game' category, but we already know all its tricks, strengths and weaknesses. Some of the series' elements were successfully recreated in other titles but none has gathered them all on one disc yet – and this is why MW3 still wins. [December 2011, p.38]", 
                "Nothing new under the sun – that's spot-on. CoD: MW3 is a great game with no innovation. The graphics are outstanding, the sound effects amazing and the multiplayer as good as ever. The short campaign, the poor soundtrack, indestructible background objects and the shallow story, told in a confusing way, are disappointing though. Still, the game is very intense and well done. A must buy for all the fans.", 
                "The singleplayer of Modern Warfare 3 closes the trilogy on a high note, the Spec Ops-mode has been improved both quality- and quantity-wise and the multiplayer has been rebalanced. But there isn't any surprise to be found in the game. It's time that the series reinvents itself before its too late, but this is still an extremely solid conclusion.", 
                "This time the single player campaign has definitely taken a backseat as it doesn't manage to offer the thrills of the previous installments. On the other hand, its excellent multiplayer will undoubtedly maintain the interest of the fans until the next installment.", 
                "A well produced title that will give you another slice of entertainment, whether you choose to go it alone or head online to kick ass and take some names. It's nothing new though, and single-player feels especially lightweight this time around, so there is still room for improvement. More of the same next year then – which is both great news and a bit disappointing really.", 
                "This game plays well but there's a big lack of innovation. The multiplayer has shown some improvements but furthermore the game is exactly like you would expect.", 
                "This is an exciting and rewarding game, but the series' signature thrills have lost some of their luster. Modern Warfare 3 iterates rather than innovates, so the fun you have is familiar. Fortunately, it's also utterly engrossing and immensely satisfying, giving fans another reason to rejoice in this busy shooter season.", 
                "Infinity Ward and Slegdehammer Games have fashioned a fantastic product, not for its fresh or innovate approach, but for the sheer content and refinements made to the existing product. The solo campaign, though short in length and somewhat lacking in climax, exemplifies flawless shooter gameplay while delivering a satisfying end to the Modern Warfare trilogy.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3, while still an excellent thrill ride in its own right, feels far too similar to MW2 or even Black Ops for my taste.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a suitable end to the Modern Warfare series, assuming this is as far as Infinity Ward takes the storyline. Every piece of the formula that has been used in the past game is here and accounted for and has been refined to a \"T\". As long as you don't expect anything more than what you are used to, you should be more than happy with the game.", 
                "The focus is clearly on the multiplayer here, and I doubt you're going to get a better FPS multiplayer experience from any other game this year.", 
                "This is easily the best Call of Duty campaign in quite some time. [Issue#79, p.68]", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is a good game, and Call of Duty fans will be happy. Those who are getting tired of Call of Duty will even be able to appreciate the changes in level progression and unlocks. At the end of the day, Modern Warfare 3 sticks to the safe formula that has worked for years, it's just that it is starting to get old.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is exactly what we expected, and depending on your stance on the series that's either good or bad.", 
                "While it is abundantly clear that this game doesn't strive for innovation, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 gives players an overall entertaining game and delivers exactly what fans of the series want..", 
                "Put that aside and enjoy Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 for what it is: a brutal and rewarding game that knows what players expect, and delivers it with well-earned confidence.", 
                "As a whole package Call of Duty is soundly, confidently and expertly put together.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 is a funny and entertaining game. If you liked the previous chapters of this huge franchise you'll love this new one. Infinity Ward has done a very good job offering a complete package with a honest single player, a great co-op and a quite different multiplayer from that of Black Ops. Unfortunately, the sensation of playing a \"more of the same\" game in quite intense.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3's campaign, while complacent in parts, builds upon the dizzy heights of spectacle set by previous entries and often exceeds them, while Spec Ops once again successfully delivers its own brand of tactical co-operative gameplay.", 
                "It will be yet another go-round on the same rollercoaster. And this time, to enjoy it fully, you won't have to measure up at a sign that says \"you must be this obsessed with multiplayer to ride this ride.\"", 
                "It's a Call Of Duty that feels incredibly focused despite a period in its development of massive uncertainty. Its campaign still toes the line between being smart and being stupid, but for Saturday night, popcorn entertainment, Modern Warfare 3 has the competition beat.", 
                "Sure, not much has happened in terms of gameplay, and if you've played any of the prequels you'll know exactly what to expect. But that doesn't stop Modern Warfare 3 from being a really entertaining piece of military action with excellent multiplayer to enjoy.", 
                "Still one of the best first-person shooters of the year...But the whole thing feels old at this point. The new tricks feel more like a distraction designed to make you forget how revolutionary Call of Duty 4 was. I will certainly buy and play a copy of Modern Warfare 3, but there's nothing here that makes me want to shut off the rest of the world and obsess over it anymore. It makes you wonder if the franchise's best days are truly behind it.", 
                "Feels like a complete package from the start; the three gameplay areas - solo, co-op and multiplayer - all feeling like parts of a cohesive whole, driven by a clear and honed declaration of intent.", 
                "Other than the Strike Packages, MW3 really is nothing we haven't already seen. This does not say you won't get your first-person shooter fix. As a standalone game, it's worth every penny and will undoubtedly keep players occupied until the next installment, but as a sequel, it's disappointing.",

I have had people spawned right in from of me into MY crosshairs! I have had the same happen to me but the other way around. I have had people spawned 5 feet away from me behind a corner. It's all part of CoD's 'payback' system. It's horrid. The spawn problems are amplified ten fold in objective based gametypes to boot. The maps are a little on the smallish side so this also makes the spawns seem even worse. I like a lot of the maps, I dont mind the smaller sizes, yet the smaller sizes combined with the spawns just make this MP nigh unplayable.A lot of people will say\"You cant sit in a corner with assassin and a silencer noob\", I'm a rusher at heart and I run around while I run and gun and STILL get people spawned mere feet away from me. Sometimes they spawn in front of me for a easy kill, and I literally LOL. In that moment it was awesome for me and builds my KS, yet soon enough (mere seconds/mins) it will happen to me.

It has to be the most annoying feature I have ever seen. It does not make you a badass player.

Of course, by looking at all of the players online, you notice they all have around 0-20 gamerscore in MW3 at the moment, simply because they bought this for the multiplayer, the infamous wife-replacing, work ditching fiasco that we've all played before. And here it is again, basically in the same form as before. Kudos on the deathstreaks and 16 launched maps, IW, but even though your formula is \"tried and true\", this game is old, already, and in need of serious nerfing patches from day one. This game turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the year, and the first slip down for the CoD franchise. Here's to hoping that they make something worth the $60 price of admission next time.

And people wonder why \"professional\" reviewers are distrusted?  |||| The sad reality of MW3 is that it looks and plays just like MW2 and Black Ops. There's little to no graphical difference between them, there's really no gameplay changes between them other than the renaming of some of the kill/death streaks. The AI is bad, the voice overs are bad, the maps are small and campy, et cetera. It's basically a carbon copy of MW2 and Black Ops. |||| Now I'm sure people will say \"the game was perfect and sold millions so they don't need to change anything\". To say the game was perfect is hubris of the highest order though no one can dispute that it sold millions. However, consider, in the same time frame, that Epic Games continually tweaked UE3 for the Gears franchise, making each one richer than the previous, DICE brought out a new engine this generation for BFBC2 and BF3, and Bungie modified the Halo 2 engine for H3 and ODST while making an entirely new engine for Halo: Reach. But Call of Duty? To quote one of its own callsigns: S.S.D.D. I don't think it's too unreasonable to ask for at least a new engine and some better graphics after all these years, even if they leave the core gameplay the same. |||| The game is enjoyable but it's AVERAGE. The engine and the gameplay style show their ages.

The fact of it is, CoD outsells itself as the highest-selling game of all time year after year, and that's for a reason. The vocal haters of CoD are in the minority, by far. Activision knows that, and they now that they are guaranteed money if they just tweak the formula and offer players *just* enough incentive to come back.

Its solo campaign boasts a good scenario, and its multiplayer is as comprehensive and solid as ever, while changing some basic systems for the better and introducing soon-to-be-cult new modes, as well as community features one could only find in the latest Halo iterations before. There may be ways to improve it yet again, but the 2010 CoD delivers on its promise - we can't say anymore that Treyarch's Call of Dutys don't measure up.",

Really no moments that are visually stunning. Given that somehow they've managed to make it run less efficiently. During my setup for single player graphics i experienced instense lag, my screen would flash yellow and i had to lower the settings down on AA AASA. At this point the game still had moments of extreme choppiness though i could play with the settings further because of the poorly done menu. Every mutliplayer game i've joined has people lagging out or crashing because of graphical issues. I run a Nvidia 480GTX, Quad-core Intel, 8GB of ram and I STILL get lag in this game (yes i have the latest drivers). The game play is the roughly the same as the first but it feels less fluid, the AI does nothing but get in the way the entire time, you basically feel like your just running through a movie and only you down know the script. You end up having to kill everything you see as your AI squad members really dont do anything except follow their scripts. In this game they've simply reused what they had and spent even less time on making it feel \"epic\" and even less time on the menu system of the game which at this point its so PC unfriendly that it makes me want to cry.The list of complaints tends to drag on but over all the fact that this was a $59.99 for an even shorter game than the first, using the same engine, same everything is really just criminal. I regret spending my $60 for something that should have been in the $30 price range as an expansion.To  the Critic's that have reviewed this. Did you even play Modern Warfare 2? How can people even suggest that this \"tops\" that? You had to crawl through a trench under heavy machine gun fire in front of the WHITE HOUSE in the first one, nuclear war, defending the homeland they managed to hit every button to get people to connect with their game.

Addictive multiplayer, descent story, amazing Zombies, and great replay ability. Unlike some reviewers, I do not think Black Ops is similar to previous games in the series, except in the core defining features that make it Call of Duty. I, personally, consider this the best game in the series. That being said, It is hard to argue this game is flawless. While the campaign is the best yet, the easier difficulties are altogether to easy. Honestly, in many cases you can simply sit back and let your bot allies take care of the enemies. The exception to this is veteran, which is extremely challenging. Unfortunately, there really is no medium difficulty for Black Ops. That being said, the campaign is fun and exciting, with a story that is surprisingly interesting for a Call of Duty game. Multiplayer wise, Black Ops is like any other Call of Duty. Addicting, but frustrating. Due to the majority of players buying Call of Duty for the multiplayer, I will review this section extensively. To begin, the multiplayer, like any other CoD, is fast-paced and frantic. Even though Treyarch increased the amount of damage you take, you still die quickly and you will not find yourself getting away from gunfights in most scenarios. In addition, the guns in Black Ops are disappointing. If you are trying to do well, the assault rifles are vastly superior to all other gun's, save the AK74u. That being said, in and of themselves, the assault rifles are balanced and each fun to use in their own way. Additionally, the sub machine guns, shotguns, and Light Machine Gun's are all balanced and unique, if not for the Assault Rifles outshining them in most situations. Finally, the Sniper Rifles are, sadly, useless in this game, and you will not be able to quickscope like previous Call of Duty's. While this may come to a relief to some, because Treyarch made only a couple sniper-friendly maps, the Sniper is a gun that could have easily been left out without being missed. Customization wise,Treyarch brings many new attachments, camos, perks, and kill streaks. Although some could argue kill streaks underpowered, all in all the customization is balanced and, depending on the different load outs you go with, the game can feel very different. Unlike previous Call of Duty games, the grenade launcher has a very reasonable blast radius and, when against Flak Jacket (A perk that gives you extra explosive resistance) its overall useless.  On the gameplay aspect, the map's are fun and interesting, the gameplay is fluid, the control's flawless, and the graphics passable. Unfortunately, the spawns could use some tweaking. Depending on the game mode you play, you can easily be trapped in your spawn or, on the opposite side of things, switch spawns to easily and spawn behind enemies, or vise-versa. Additionally, the matchmaking is not ideal. In many cases, when playng with parties, you will get into a game with a few people missing. This never happened in previous call of duties and, even worse, you could get into a game that is already, in essence, a loss. Finally, I will address the zombie mode. Zombie's is arguably the best part of Black Ops. There is something altogether to satisfying by annihilating endless zombie hordes with a couple of friends. On the later rounds, it takes a lot of teamwork to survive. Black Ops comes with 2 map's, Kino der Toten and Five. Although Five is not as enjoyable for me, Kino der Toten is extremely fun and pack's hours of play. In addition, if you purchased the Hardened addition to Black Ops, you will gain access to the 4 zombie maps from WaW with modern weapons. While all fun, my personal favorite is Der Reise. Finally, if you purchase the fifteen dollar map pack you will gain the ability to play Ascension, my favorite zombie map. Ascension is surprisingly complicated for a zombie map, even coming with a side-objective to try if your feeling lucky. Unfortunately, its not easy and you'll need a full party of four. In the end, Black Ops is a very fun game that deserves your purchase, especially if you enjoyed the previous call of duties. Although the Multiplayer will surely attract most, be sure not to overlook Zombies and the Campaign. My only caution is that multiplayer, even the campaign in some parts, will be frustrating. However, if this happens just take a break and come back later. My final thoughts, great purchase, but if your not a fan of shooters I would let this one pass.… Expand",

Graphics were good (if a little outdated on the engines part), and mechanics were just as good as they've ever been.Online is a bit of a different story.

Weapons are amazing and the actual 'stories' behind the maps are engaging and sometimes downright hilarious.My totals add up to an 8.5/10.

While Infinity Ward gives us Modern Warfare, Treyarch just sticks with a World At War. While Inifinity Ward decides to stomp on innovation, Treyarch experiments with new things- not always to success, but who blames them? With Black Ops, fans finally accepted Treyarch, even though they still stuck to the past. The thing is, they crawled out of their muddy trench to deliver an intense Cold war thriller that doesn't pull any punches and also provides the right amount of innovation to propel this series for another year. Between a brilliant campaign, addictive multiplayer and the outrageously fun Zombies mode, Black Ops triumphs as the fourth best COD in the series...\r Let's begin with the main attraction, the multiplayer. While it certainly isn't a revolution, it is an utterly polished and infinitely replayable experience. The new modes are fast paced and fun and TDM and FFA are still excellent. Rather than sticking to my guns, I experimented with new modes for fun and found myself enjoying the game even more. The levelling and progression systems haven't innovated too much, but they are still well designed and easier to comprehend than Battlefield (before anybody screams hate at me for saying that, I am not a fanboy for either of them and believe they are as good as one another). The Create A Class and customization options are where this game really shines, where the better interfaces and menus make for a more accessible experience. The large range of perks and scorestreaks means that your experience can be incredibly different from anyone else's and there is a large amount of gear that just caters to newbies (or noobies). As for the guns- by god are they amazing! Each one feels different and the awesome amount of upgrades and levelling turns this into an RPG for weapons. You can get your weapons gold or diamond and the amount of clan options makes this mode an even more desired option. The party modes are also great, with gun game easily being the best.\r While all of this may be amazing, the maps are some of the best in COD history. Nuketown is an excellent setting and is an instant classic, with its bright colours and small, intense design. While there are a few too many snow maps, Firing Range is another classic and the jungle and city set maps are also great. Black Ops embraces the intense, close quarters combat of the series and this is its greatest strength.\r Then there are the zombies. One of the most surprising things about World At War was its unlockable Zombies mode and that returns for BLOPS, but you can play one of the maps from the start while the other two are only obtainable after completing the campaign. This is agood design decision, as this is one of the best co-op experiences in all of history. It starts off easy, but as you progress, the zombies get faster, the hordes get larger and hellhounds appear. The main map is nothing compared to BLOPSII and its Transit, but it is arguably more focused and just better. The amount of hidden secrets constantly encourages replayability and this mode has that \"just one more go\" mentality about it. It keeps the money and weapons systems and the intense difficulty and isn't a large step up form WAW, but who cares? Zombies!!!\r The last of the three modes in BLOPs is the campaign. While it isn't as shocking as MW2, it is just as good.  The set pieces continue to increase in size and scale, with a crossbow focused snow level, the opening sequence and the final attack being particular highlights. There are the usual collectibles and replaying the campaign isn't a bad option, but this an experience to be had just once, simply because the final twist just doesn't have the same impact the second time around.\r The story sees you playing as Alex Mason- a soldier who has been captured and is undergoing interrogation, due to his suspicious behaviour and potential involvement in a terrorist attack. The whole game recounts his adventures, but you will occasionally switch roles for a greater narrative base. The characters are memorable and the fairly good looking graphics engine ensures that it can all be pulled off in an incredibly realistic and atmospheric way. The Cold War backdrop is what really give this game its legs, what with it seemingly being the perfect time period for a COD game. I love this campaign and it is easily one of the best in the series.\r Everything about BLOPs is polished and well executed. It controls well, the performances and score are brilliant and it looks great as well- even 4 years on. The campaign, multiplayer and Zombies mode still aren't highly innovative, but who cares? This is some of the best fun in COD in years. Treyarch is better than Infinity Ward anyway...… Expand",

I thought Call of Duty 3 was a good game, too. Accordingly, I had high expectations for Treyarch. I can't say I hate Black Ops, because I don't, I just don't LOVE it. First off, let's start with the perks - The Campaign blew me away. I thought it would be a Modern Warfare 2-style thing with a little more stealth and set in the 60`s. Hey, I wouldn't have had a problem with that, Modern Warfare 2's Campaign was great for me. Black Ops blew that out of the water... It was amazing. I'm not the most skilled player out there, Regular is about where I'm at. Every CoD game prior to this bored me at some point and just seemed too hard... Never did this happen in Black Ops. Treyarch's story is amazing, and I'd buy \"Black Ops 2\" or whatever just to see what else happens to Mason and Hudson and everyone... I actually felt attached to the characters this time. Next - Zombies. Kino Der Toten is one of the best Zombie Maps out there, better than the amazing Der Riese, which, until now, was my favorite map. Dempsy, Nikolai, Takeo and Richtofen are hilarious, and they can make an impossible situation to overcome all the brighter. Plus, I've never had so much fun slaughtering zombies as a Presidential Aid... Ever! \"Five\" is another great map in Zombies where you play as JFK, Robert McNamara, Richard Nixon and Fidel Castro as you hold off hordes of the undead in the Pentagon. How that makes any sense, I don't know. Just go with it. Split-screen System Link and XBL is also a great feature, even if it is only 2 players - my brother and I both have our own Xbox and Black Ops, so we're never short of players for a zombie match. The game's graphics are good, but not great - Reach's outshine them by a long shot, but Black Ops, like W@W, has very realistic gore in it, which Reach lacks. Now for the negatives... Multiplayer. Most people only play Call of Duty anymore for the online Multiplayer. You guys, back off, Black Ops's MP is awful. The maps are basically just a bunch of corridors and a few back alleys with windows to give people a \"sniping perch.\" FAIL. Fifteen feet isn't nearly enough room to merit a sniper rifle use... heck, an MP5K would work better. Speaking of that, SMG`s seem to dominate the maps due to the lack of space. Snipers, as said before, out of the picture. LMG`s need a little room to use... The Stoner 63 is the only one worth using AT ALL, but you can't get that until you've bought all of the other LMG`s that you'll likely never use. AR`s are still useful, and Shotguns, primaries again, are actually usable to the same degree of effectiveness as, say, the M60 (LMG). All the weapons shoot a lot better than MW2's, though, so on the only good maps, Jungle and Array, it's actually fun to use them - heck, you can even snipe on these maps! I'd like to complain about the unlock system, though - I love the emblem creator and the fact that you can buy any perk you want at any time, saves me a lot of crap. But I no longer feel encouraged to use a weapon a lot so I can unlock all the attachments. In MW2, I'd stick with the M4 or whatever until I'd gotten everything, except Extended Mags (too hard for me lol) and the Shotgun (I loathe Noob Tubes, I only managed to unlock the shotgun for my absolute FAVORITE guns). Now, you buy each gun for 2000 CoD points, and then any attachment for 1000 - Suppressors are 2000, and Noob Tubes are 3000. Then you're finished. I don't want to waste my CoD points trying out different attachments. MW2 MADE you use them to get XP and more attachments. I now LOVE the ACOG Scope on the ACR - I never would've used that if the Thermal Scope hadn't been involved. There's no motivation here. I didn't realize that I liked the M16 with an ACOG Scope until just recently, whereas I'd have used it the instant I got it to get that Thermal (Infrared, in BO) Scope.Final thoughts - Good Game. Campaign gets 8.25/10 (Due to shortness). Zombies gets 10/10, and Multiplayer gets 3.5/10, terrible, save for that rare match on Array where I can crawl up onto the radio tower and snipe for a while.… Expand",

Just by virtue of being a Treyarch game that doesn't completely suck, this somehow translates into being on par with the best in the genre?

However, this game gets away easy in reviews when it comes to this. Why? It's \"Call of Duty\".Aside from the visuals, the sound design is also mediocre. Listen to this next to \"Medal of Honor\" on a sound system (or heck; just your TV) and tell me which has the better sound mix. Hint: It is not \"Black Ops\". In fact, \"Medal of Honor\" has the best sound mix I have ever heard in a game. It is truly an acoustic marvel, and deserves to be heard.Adding insult to injury, a set of spastic, drugged-out-of-their-minds and pathetically acted scenes is what we get to tie everything together. \"Black\" did this in a much better way in 2006. On the Xbox and PS2, nonetheless.Also, many have made a point out of the ethical dilemma one faces when setting a FPS to a real world war. How the situation demands respect and thought. In this regard, in whatever way \"Medal of Honor\" failed to do so in regards to the current war in Afghanistan absolutely pales in comparison to the travesty Treyarch gives us here. JFK as a zombie-killer side-by-side with Castro? Now there is respect and historical accuracy for you! The Infinity Ward games, while being ridiculous at times, at least knew where to draw the line.

Not to mention just endless waves of zombies gets old quick.  The co-op in MW2 had hours of excitement  for me and my friends. We had to function like a small Spec-ops team to complete the maps. You needed: communication, precision, and teamwork to do the missions.

There is a \"Combat Training\" mode you can play privately with your  friends, but event the AI runs around like decapitated chickens.

It's not the perfect game - graphics are a bit dated, some parts on MP are a little buggy, but I've played worse. Namely, MW2.Let me explain. MW2's singleI really don't understand why so many people are giving this game a zero. I think that people are just stretching the truth to make the game seem worse than it actually is because they have something against Activision and Treyarch. It's not the perfect game - graphics are a bit dated, some parts on MP are a little buggy, but I've played worse. Namely, MW2.Let me explain. MW2's single player was extremely addictive, if a bit short, but I played through it at least three times. The multiplayer, however, was broken. Campers and boosters everywhere, quickscoping was rampant, and you had squeakers trash talking you every time you played something that wasn't vanilla TDM. So, I traded it in and waited for Black Ops to come out.The single player in Black Ops, while I haven't finished it, has its good and bad points. The cut-scenes are incredible and the story immersing, but there's no introduction. I found that kind of weird. Also, I'm stuck on a mission where the instructions seem to be misleading - but I put that down to my lack of prowess at video games in general.So far, I've spent most of my time in Multiplayer. I had to say, I wasn't expecting much after MW2 and it's horrendous multiplayer feature. The matchmaking system didn't inspire much confidence either - I don't seem to be able to get a 4 bar connection in any games that I've played, while I had 4 bars every time in MW2. My major gripe is the broken matchmaking system, particularly in Wager Matches actually. Despite there being 15k people in Gun Game, it takes on average 5 minutes for me to join a game. Sticks and Stones isn't much better, and Sharpshooter is incredibly broken. I don't think I've actually played a game of Sharpshooter where it didn't switch to a random game mode afterward. One In The Chamber seems to be the only game mode that's perfect. Speaking of Wager Matches, I like the CoD points idea. It adds a dimension to the game - do I save up and get this gun, or do I spend it as soon as I unlock this one?This, however, presents another problem. I played this game at launch and since most people still had the crappy guns you start off with, so I didn't notice this issue at first. However, once people unlock the AK74u and the FAMAS, the starter guns become completely obsolete. People who play 24h a day to get the best guns will have an advantage over people who play 2h a week at best, like me. The guns you have until about level 14 aren't balanced with the rest of the guns. I almost gave up the game because the Enfield, the MP5K and the Skorpion prove absolutely useless. Once you get there, though, the guns are well balanced, and each serves its own distinctive purpose. It takes forever to level up to get to the good stuff, so if you stick with it you will be rewarded.Moving on. I like that Black Ops is less of a \"twitch shooter\" than MW2 was. The game doesn't center round the knife because it can be beaten very easily. Grenade Launchers have been nerfed in several ways, including the price, the blast radius and the fact that Warlord (BO's version of Bling) doesn't work if you equip a grenade launcher. Quickscoping is nearly impossible to do now - good news for everyone over the age of 12. Camping spots are fewer and farther between, and, with the exception of a few maps, camping doesn't really help you. The nuke has been taken out, which is a plus. The Chopper Gunner and the Gunship don't stack on to your killstreak, and they are less powerful now. Because of all of these combined, I feel less like, \"C'mon, gotta get my Harrier... FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUU I DIED\" and more like \"Oh cool, I got a Helicopter.\" when you get killstreaks. I could go on all day about what I like, frankly, but there's not enough room here.In short, I feel that Black Ops has taken everything good about MW2, and filtered out the annoyances. If you liked MW2, you'll love this. If you didn't, however, don't buy it, and stop writing zero-rated reviews full of fluff on how you prefer Battlefield, Medal of Honor, etc - go play that, instead of complaining.… Expand",

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nMany of my friends and various critics are raving about this jewel encrusted gift from the heavens, COD Black Ops; because of their rave review I went out and spent 60$ on this game. Put it in the Xbox and was immediately blown away by the fantastic opening cut scene and neat menu, selected my difficulty and began my experience. I though the whole interrogation thing was pretty cool, even though it was exactly like the one in Black for the PS2 some years ago, and began playing the first mission. Liked it at first and close up the graphics in the \"cut scenes\" were pretty good. Then I walked out of the bar and began shooting. that is when I noticed the terrible visuals. After about 30ft everything just blends together and becomes one massive blob of brown. I failed that mission a few times because I shot civilians instead of soldiers because I couldn't tell the difference; the visuals are that muddy. The weapon sounds also don't sound very good either. Whatever I thought, a bit of a sacrifice for good game play right? Wrong. After shooting a large number of endlessly re-spawning enemies, which all look identical by the way, I got to an alley with a car. I thought, \"Wow please don't tell me I have to drive that?\" remembering all the terrible driving sections in Treyarch's previous COD titles. Sure enough I have to drive it that was terrible, however, you smash through a road block which was pretty good but I missed most of the awesomeness of the situation  because the screen fades and they yank you back to the stupid interrogation which just reiterates plot points that we all got hours ago. This wouldn't be so bad, but it seems, especially in the beginning of the game, they do this during every awesome moment of game play. After some more cut scenes I'm in prison with Reznov, and fighting my way past many Russian prison guards, that again, look all the same. This mission annoyed me. At one point a hallway opens up with a room at the end with enemies in, it turn out this is where they all endlessly re-spawn. if you walk down it it fails you. Not fair considering it never warns you or anything. It does this a few times in the game. It fails the mission for no reason, just because you didn't do something that the game never explained or because you walked down a hallway.So you escape and so begins the rather preposterous, linear and samey, story of Mason. You skip about time and every location on the globe killing everything you see, mostly Russians. The missions are very gimmicky and would only be appealing if you don't have a brain and are easily distracted by action cinema cliches. Missions involve you following a linear path doing the same thing again and again, fighting of waves of re-spawning enemies. Also, all of the characters confuse swearing for wit. More F-Bombs are dropped in the first minute of game play than in all COD games combines.  The campaign isn't terrible, but it isn't anything new or exciting. It is a little longer than MW2s campaign but not nearly as good. Now as I'm explaining this to me friends the insist to me that the campaign isn't that good. They say to me, \"Well hey yeah multiplayer makes up for it though.\" \"It is the best in any COD game.\" I question why I should pay 60$ for a game that is only have good, but they convinced me to try it,Multiplayer is even worse. Let's start with the Zombie modes. Zombies had always been fun. Now it isn't. The maps are so huge, dark and confusing that it isn't fun. It is just frustrating. the characters and their voices are still as annoying as in WAW. Voice acting in this game is generally not very good,  just so annoying.  Now online multiplayer. the first thing I noticed was the extremely confusing menu. It has so many options and information hidden in so many menus that it makes Microsoft Access look fun and inviting. So I get into a game and the next thing I notice is the lame controls. The sticks respond even slower than in single player. Also, the maps are all horrible. Terrible lay outs and spawns coupled with the graphical issue make spotting enemies nearly impossible. There are very few good perks, weapons do no damage, especially early level ones. Not to mention they all have the same rear iron sight, that is on backwards, and the fact that half them weren't even invented yet. What really makes multiplayer unplayable is the lag and connections. It takes ages to find a game and when it does it usually lags so bad that you can't move or it just kicks you or someone in your party out of the game. Not fun. Unlocks are dumb as well. Why should I have to unlock game modes and buy guns and attachments that I already unlocked? So if you are stupid enough to wast all your money on a gun that isn't very good you're stuck with it. Kill streaks are even more game breaking than in MW2 . So to sum everything up, a very overpriced, over hyped, generic FPS. Not bad not good.… Expand",

You felt free to act, and on veteran, the game was still challenging.  The worlds were large, and the enemies didn't re-spawn to infinity. This allowed you to actually be creative in your strategy, instead of tunneling. You could fall back, flank, snipe, or rush.  Level design facilitated all strategies and the AI responded. Some levels set up better for different strategies, but the important thing is that it felt organic.  When players died, they felt they could do something different--that they had control.A majority of the positive reviews for this game focus on its numerous improvement over other Treyarch offerings, which is a valid statment. The graphics, story, voice acting, and music are a step up, as well as the addition of some \"cool moments,\" and extras like Zombies. However, there are serious problems that get brushed over.  I feel like multilayer issues have been covered. So this review will tackle single player.On easier difficulties, it does seem fluid.  The fundamental problems only express themselves at the more difficult settings. This is largely due to the fact that Treyarch uses infinite enemy spawns to compensate for poor, predictable level design and sub-par AI.  Eventually you realize that besides a few \"cool\" roller-coaster moments type moments--fun but there's only one track, most of the game consists of a long corridor or enclosed \"box\" with predictably placed pieces of cover.  Yes, you are in a box. Even though there are things going on outside the \"box\" and the graphics seemingly connect them, you cannot interact with them. Visually its a large world; in practice it's claustrophobic.  Enemies advance mindlessly in single file from the back of the cover to your position, eventually charging recklessly from the last piece of cover.  To \"kill\" them you need to toss smoke grenades, sprint past some imaginary line, and hunker down.  If you get unlucky and get shot in the face, prepare to live the last 5 minutes of your life over and over again.Lets be frank--in the early versions of the game, this was a necessity because of inherent technical limitations.  The \"box\" existed because large interactive environments weren't possible. The endless spawns were needed because AI was terrible.  It was necessary to have smoke grenades because these other compensations made certain configurations of enemies and cover frustrating.   Purists might say \"This is Call of Duty,\"  but how many other games get bad marks for refusing to innovate from their predecessors?In Black-Ops it feels like you just got unlucky playing the exact same interaction over and over again in the only way possible to play it. More specifically, it feels like you are forced to engage in the same interaction, requiring the same strategy with the same probability of success again and again.  You are bound to get unlucky and die, even doing the right thing.  When you do, unpredictable load points reward you with the with the same set of identical interactions and identical solutions.Throw smoke and run into it seems like a poor mechanic after a while. In IW games you throw smoke to get a tactical advantage, get a way, or provide temporary cover to move to a new position.  In Treyarch games, you do it because its the best way to stop infinite spawns.  The former feels immersive, the latter feels like band-aid for poor game design.Halo got a lot of crap for repeated area designs, but at least there were multiple ways to attack each situation.  As Bungie put it, it was the same â… Expand",

All weapons are balanced, but automatic weapons have a sight advantage due to the more shots it takes to bring down and opponent, but the M16s are best for long range shooting anyways. Also, the fact that killstreaks do not stack anymore focuses more on the shooting nature of the game, as CoD4 did. This is a huge relief, and rises out of the killstreak heavy MW2 gameplay.The best addition is the way you buy weapons. They are unlocked regularly, but now you can buy the attachments, instead of playing countless games, slaving to get fmj for a weapon. This addition helps the game focus more on the gameplay. The addition of diving to prone is also a helpful addition to get a jump on the enemy.The addition of theater mode is a nice touch as well, giving players the halo treatment. Also, custom matches finally organize private no scope matches. Also, the ability to personalize weapons and emblems really gives the player a larger sense of creativity.Finally, with the addition of split screen online multiplayer, players can also entertain their friends with an online experience that was only provide before by halo. This is a feature that fans screamed for and someone FINALLY listened.The campaign in this game is much better than the previous games. The player is put into the middle of a grand mystery of the main characters mind. The government is trying to exract information that was wiped after your character went missing in action. The player goes through their characters past experiences and finds unique twists.The Zombies mode is slightly bumped down from WaW, with the addition of wierd crawling zombies that disorient the player. It seems Treyarch tried to complicate this mode more than it should have been. But the fact that players can control Presidents JFK and Nixon against Nazi Zombies is as humorous as it is fun. The downfalls of this game happen in the multiplayer maps and graphics department. The half the maps are  fine, but some maps are too large for simple team deathmatches. Expect games to go on for the full length of time due to the large amounts of places players can hide. No one finds anyone for 30 seconds sometimes. Also, the graphics seem like a major step down from MW2. This game lost MW2's realism, but that does not mean that the game looks terrible to any extend. Just different.All in all, Call of Duty Balck Ops is the greatest of the series so far. The improvements shadow the minor glitches and out dated graphics.

MW2 also had balanced maps where sniping was at least possible. When they announced they were removing Stopping Power from the game i was ecstatic i thought they would finally realize that  A BULLET IS A BULLET!!!! guns should not have damage stats. They should remove damage as a stat for weapons and focus primarily on range, accuracy, mobility and rate of fire. if you get hit with a bullet you DIE. just because my gun has 4 bars of Damage and yours has 5 does not mean u win a fire fight when i put 3 rounds into your skull. If you, like myself, loved sniping well then your out of luck in order to fight the \"War on Quickscoping\" that Treyarch believes is happening they made it so if you  don't aim down the sights for a full 2 seconds your bullet flies in some random direction like a revolutionary war musket. Threyarch needs to stop making promises they cant keep. they said it would be close to impossible to hack this game well its been a little over a month since the games release and there are already Wall hacks, Aim-bots, God Mode, No Clip, Infinite Ammo and much much more. The spawn system is non existent as well the game will consistently spawn you in the same location so some retard can run over to you place a sentry gun at your spawn and rack up the kills. The lag is also an extreme issue, if you do not have a 4 bar connection then it is virtually impossible to get a legitimate kill. Even at 3 bars bullets fail to register and do almost no damage. In MW2 it felt as if maybe 10-15% of your bullets might go unaccounted for well in BO change that to at least 50-75% of them. That may be an over exaggeration to some people but when you unload 15 bullets into one guy just to have him wheel around and shoot you twice in the leg and kill you something is definitely wrong. This game practically rewards mediocrity, the RC car is the most OP kill-streak ever put into a game, a 3 year old child with down syndrome could get the 2 kills in a row it takes ( i know its 3 kills but since everyone turns hard-line on anyway, you might as well make it 2) to get that reward. people literally can just do completely **** the whole game and towards the end just say, \" hey look i have ten RCXD's to spawn kill people with\". This game literally has  so many bugs that  by gaming \"law\" is Literally considered BROKEN. just to name a few... Railings: the spaces between railings on balcony's and stairs are programed as \"walls\" so you either can or can not shoot through them while doing minimal damage, Wanted: this is just what I'm calling it since i do not know the exact term, but when people shoot behind you as you run around cover and despite not hitting you at all the bullets almost seem to curve around the corner and get you anyway,KNIFING: its broken now so don't even try. the prime rule is, If you think you got him...you didn't. If you think you didn't get him... then you did. Air knifes are much more common then MW2 and 3arc really doesn't seem to care about it. This game literally did nothing new to the Cod franchise beside steal a bunch of ideas from Halo like their \"new\" currency system and map selecting in Multi player. Overall this is a piss poor game with outdated graphics and a Company backing it, cough* cough* Activision, that's to greedy to give a **** that their game has some serious problems that need addressing. If you wonder why the graphics are bad then, again look at Activison, they thought it would be a good idea to make the game 3D compatible so they down graded the graphics to satisfy the 2%  margin of gamers with 3D TV's. Seriously if your going to market to a certain group then you should pick a larger one then that. This game, just like Modern Warfare 2, was fun at first but now is just another failed project. And to those who might say, \"Oh you just suck, thats why ur mad\", no, my KD is 2.05 and it i have 15,000 kills so no. I just know what a good game is, and this is not it.

The single player campaign is just a bunch of random scenarios tied together with a ridiculously predictable plot.  The multiplayer maps are mediocre compared to modern warfare 1 and 2 maps.  But I guess they are designed for people who would rather mindlessly run at each other than climb even a simple learning curve.  Why else would nuketown be voted for over and over again for hours before the patch limiting replaying a map was released.  Which leads me to spawn locations.  In every CoD I have never been killed or got a kill within a seconds of spawning as much as I do in black ops.  This games adds nothing new to the series besides tomahawks and wager matches that usually rely more on luck than any skill, so it drives me crazy how so many \"critics\" sellout and give this game such high ratings just to appeal to the masses when other game sequels are bashed for being just a reiteration of a previous release.  Maybe if the next CoD brings back the quality and entertainment of the first modern warfare the \"critics\" will throw tens at it claiming it is the best fps ever created.  Who knows, OXM might even give it an 11, of course then they would start giving tons of games 11 and make a 12 to justify the scores...Overall I would give this game a 6 just because S&D; can be a lot of fun, but every time I play I remember how much more fun I had on better made maps with a wider variety of weapons worth using.  But I'm gonna have to go with 0 to balance out the people giving 10's with reasons such as \"by far the most complete and deep gaming experience in history\" or \"I don't understand why so many people are complaining about this game.\" or my favorite \"I detect battlefield fanboys in these reviews. a 0 without any reasoning to back it up?\", by the way he doesn't give a single reason why the game deserves the 10 he gave it.… Expand",

I'm not trying to sound like an MW2 fanboy or a Halo fanboy, but both of those games improved on and at least added new controls, weapons, equipment, etc. Black Ops is pretty repetitive at best in certain game types, and they are usually dominated by one team that is filled with campers, people that exploit broken combinations, and similar things.

That being said there are some lingering issues that really hold this game back. 1. The A.I. is just terrible. I know COD has never been accused of having great A.I. but Black Ops really seems to make it worse. There are numerous times where your allies and enemies will simply ignore each other.. I've witnessed an A.I. teammate and enemy literally standing back to back firing in opposite directions, completely oblivious to the others presence. You'll see your teammates run right past enemies, I mean they'll pass each other on a narrow pathway without even a nod. It's just weird, and it happens frequently enough that you can't help but notice it and feel disappointed.2. Instant deaths... I don't know if the enemy headshot percentages were boosted or what but I found myself dying inexplicably a number of times during the campaign. As in other CODs once you start taking hits the screen starts turning red until you can't hardly see  and then die. Generally you have a pretty good idea of how much punishment you can take before you die. But in Black Ops I found myself going from perfectly fine to dead instantly. And the game always tells you if you die from a grenade or exploding barrel or something like that, so I know that's not the issue. The only thing I can come up with is that I was hit in the head, but if that's the case then the enemies accuracy must have really been cranked up. Either way it becomes incredibly frustrating when you die out of nowhere, and it's not something that I've witnessed happening in any of the other CODs.3. The Story...it's not terrible, but it's not very original either. I was interested at first, there's an air of mystery, but once I realized where the story was going I just found myself going through the motions to finish the game. The game treats the big reveal like a shocking surprise, but really, you saw it coming a few levels back. That's not to say the last few levels are bad, they're actually very good, and the final level is great, it's just the story that accompanies it fizzles out by that point.Then there's the multiplayer....think of it as a huge map pack for Modern Warfare 2. If you didn't know the maps you'd have a hard time knowing which one was which if you were watching them side-by-side. I almost wish they'd gone back to WWII just for the multiplayer. At least then it would feel distinct. World at War had its own style that I really enjoyed, so I was a bit disappointed when I first saw Blacks Ops multiplayer in action. It's good. It has some great new modes and the wager matches are a fine idea. COD points are a nice touch for upgrading your equipment the way YOU want to instead of everyone at say level 35 having the same things unlocked. So overall I think it is an improvement over Modern Warfare 2 and I'll certainly spend many hours playing.Black Ops is great package, and will certainly keep you occupied until the next COD lands, but for me, this is the first time I've played a COD game and thought, \"I could've probably skipped this one and never really regretted it.\"… Expand",

The only Call of Duty games that were any kind of upgrade were the Modern Warfare games. Those are fun. But what about Black Ops?

That said, this is one game I don't mind people getting rabies over. While there are a dozen or so other games I'd like to play, including one or two in the CoD series itself.The campaign is nice, though you don't learn much about the characters. Basically, the Russians have created a super-deadly bio-chemical weapon and you have to remember how to stop it's activation. It starts in an interrogation room, where you're told to try and remember what a cryptic set of numbers mean. The missions, which, speaking story-wise, are flashbacks, should take you about 15-25 minutes to complete, of which there are about 15 missions. The plot is good, with a few big twists, most of which seemed to come out of nowhere, but make you say, \"What? Oh. Oh, yeah! I get it!\". The zombies mode is back, with two built in maps, a mansion and the pentagon. Just as fun and addictive as ever.But as with any first-person shooter, the multiplayer is what everyone (but me) buys the game for. There are several great maps, including my favorite: a close quarters map called \"Nuketown\". The gamemodes include the classics like team deathmatch and a new kind of game mode called wager. In wager, you bet your currency points (called CoD points) that you'll come in the top three ranking players in the game. I don't like the wagering in this mode so much (you could win four times as much easily in a regular match without risking losing a couple), but I love the game modes, like \"One in the chamber,\" where everyone has one bullet, and if they miss, they're forced to knife their way to victory. Every kill grants you another bullet, and it's a nice twist to regular first person shooter attitude which is, \"Screw the ammo, SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT!\"All together, Black Ops is a great game, and fans of the series or genre should definitely add this to their respective collections.… Expand",

With a console-worthy list of modes and options, brand new gameplay paradigms, the best track roster in series history, and new customization depth to plumb, it certainly makes a case to be the best Mario Kart yet. It doesn't turn kart racing on its end, but it finds a near-perfect medium of similarity and discovery as it walks the fine line of risk and reward without spinning out.", 
                "Mario Kart 7 is a strong follow-up in a series which has long straddled the line between mass-appeal shoo-in and nod to the nostalgia. It doesn't take many risks, but that rarely hurts it apart from a general lack of surprises and a disappointing presence of blue turtle shells. Regardless, it's an attractive, addictive, and accessible installment with some of the best online play we've seen to date coming from Nintendo. Don't expect to be surprised, but buy with confidence all the same.", 
                "Despite the lack of innovation, all fans of the series will enjoy this seventh chapter and also in general 3DS owners should consider buying it, as it's one of the best chapters of the entire saga.",

                "Though Mario Kart 7 invents nothing, the game works wonderfully today. 16 new tracks plus 16 remakes, many online matches and an idea that continues to operate successfully. 8 players, 3D effect, fun, and hang gliding.", 
                "It's not doing anything revolutionary on it's own, but serves the loyal audience with the best offering Nintendo can muster – and that's pretty good indeed.",

Mario Kart 7 is a must-have title for every single 3DS holder with the Internet / live buddies access – mainly due to its great multiplayer. It's a pity those are not included already.", 
                "Even with Retro Studios helping the 7th installment is pretty much the same game. At minimum unfair elements like the blue shells should be corrected. Still even with the ultra-conservative approach multiplayer is satisfying. [Jan 2012]", 
                "This is still the same Mario Kart as you've played over and over again. You still drive in karts, trying (and failing) to avoid different projectiles while crying foul at the competition. It's also just as addicting as ever.", 
                "The game doesn't re-invent the wheel, or even try to, but what it does, it does well.", 
                "While the game is starting to show its age and display a slight lack of imagination, it's safe to say that there aren't too many Nintendo 3DS games that can match the enjoyment derived from Mario Kart 7.", 
                "It's another Mario Kart game, through and through. The formula remains unchanged with Nintendo hesitant on adding anything more than minor details. Luckily, the formula's a good one.", 
                "Solid gameplay, inspired design and great graphics. Mario Kart 7 is not a revolution, but it's exactly the racing game that 3DS needs.",

The new gliding experience is quite interesting and represents the best  innovation in this franchise. This is an awesome game for the newcomers, but veteran players could be a little bit tired by the \"new console, same game\" strategy.", 
                "It's frustrating, rewarding, addictive and entertaining in almost equal measure, and as much as you'll rant and moan when your lead is snatched away on the last corner, you'll keep going back for more. To call it the best original game on 3DS might be overstretching the meaning of the word 'original' but, all the same, this is something that no 3DS owner should be without.",

                "If MK7 is so brilliant, though, where's that fifth star? I'm withholding it because the best thing you can say about this is that while it improves on a near-perfect 64-bit game, it doesn't make any major advances. The 3D is excellently done, but totally disposable (in fact, you probably will dispose of it before you get your first cup).", 
                "Quotation forthcoming.", 
                "It's robust, but it lacks some creative effort on Nintendo's part. Newcomers will love it, while series stalwarts will find its novelties welcome, if largely inconsequential. But it's nevertheless one of the stronger entries in the series, balancing the orthodox precision of the original with the playful silliness of the more recent iterations more successfully than ever.", 
                "When you're on the track, Mario Kart 7 feels better than any Mario Kart before it, and for most fans of the series that will be enough. But it's the same basic formula we've seen in every Mario Kart since the SNES original.",

By all means, it's fun the way only Mario Kart can be, itlooks more stunning than ever before and if you need new tracks it caneasily offer hours of entertainment. But Nintendo must have made this game on autopilot.",

                "Whether you love this iteration or not relies entirely on your tolerance of Mario Kart being Mario Kart. Unbalanced, flukey, stagnant even, but still managing to offer plenty of fun.", 
                "Fans of the games don't want an overhaul or drastic innovation but just an understanding that Mario Kart needs to shift forward with bolder moves rather than tentative baby steps. Nintendo need to be braver in their thinking and stop considering the franchise along straight lines.", 
                "This time, the changes are a scattering of smaller ones. Track layout tweaks, customization quirks, 3D effects, first-person karting, and a power-up that adds to the general level of kart chaos by letting one player unleash seven items.

Being the successor to Mario Kart DS, the best if not, one of the best Mario Kart games ever, consider me a bit disappointed. Mario Kart 7 is a good game by all means but it's a a step down from Mario Kart DS. Let's talk about the good things first. The gameplay is still as solid as any Mario Kart game, you can now customize your own kart, the track selection is excellent, they fixed the rubberband AI from Mario Kart Wii (thank god) and the multiplayer is as good or maybe even better than Mario Kart Wii's multiplayer. The big problem with this game is the content. Mario Kart DS' biggest high point was the high amounts of content it offered and being a generation ahead of MKDS, Mario Kart 7 should've done more and it's the same story all over again with the content issues of New Super Mario Bros. Wii where Nintendo are just being damn lazy. To be fair, I guess I'm judging this game by the standards of what made Mario Kart DS so perfect but MKDS was a generation behind and Mario Kart 7 is in a brand new generation. It needs to be bigger, it needs something new and it needs to have more than its predecessors offered. Gliding and going under water is not going big, Nintendo. Overall, it's still a solid Mario Kart game but for the love of god, try harder Nintendo.… Expand",

Even then, you'll get a whole new challenge unlocked in the mirror mode.

I wish it had a \"party system\" for joining races with friends, and I'm sad there isn't a voice chat feature between even registered friends. Instead, it's oversimplified to make everything easy, while making joining your friends a little difficult. You can create your own groups and invite your friends only to make it easier to race with them, but unless you have lots of friends playing all at once you cannot participate in the 8-player races this way. The new items are pretty fun, but I miss the fake item boxes and Boo. I feel some of the character selection could have been better as well.

That being said, I would like to just say what I like and dislike about the game. First off, I love the graphics and controls. At first, the driving feels a bit weird, but once you get used to it, you'll be zipping through the maps with ease. I also love the gliding and the underwater parts on each map. They make it more dynamic and more atmospheric. The game is colorful and bright but also dark in some areas as well. I also found that the 16 old maps are actually revamped and some even seem like totally different maps. The 16 new maps are amazing, my favorite being Rock Rock Mountain or Wario Shipyard. There are 32 maps, and all of them are fun to play on. The multiplayer is rock solid as well. It's fleshed out pretty well and there's almost no lag to worry about. The things I dislike are the AI and that goddamn blue shell. The AI in 150cc are pretty difficult to overcome and the blue shell almost always hits me on the last lap. These are old problems that Mario Kart fans should come to terms with however. Overall, it's a great racing game, with a decent roster, really fun courses, solid online multiplayer and good graphics.

By 3DS standards, they're amazing.  However, there are also a few criticisms to this game.  The first thing is that there is no versus mode.  This made me very disappointed because that was my favorite mode of the regular DS version.  In versus mode, you were able to start your own Grand Prix, and choose the settings to fit your needs.  You could choose the A.I. level, the rules, the engine size, the number of races needed to win, and whether or not you want a team.  The 3DS version doesn't have this.  It probably has it in multiplayer only now, but I don't play the game on multiplayer so this is a let down for me.  Also, the game may have a customizable car, but the rest of the options are limited to what you can change within the game.  The rest of the game more than makes up for this short-coming.  However, if I had to pick a favorite, I'm afraid I'll have to say that Mario Kart DS is better than Mario Kart 7.  Mario Kart DS has more customizable options, has a versus mode, and still stays true to the Mario Kart formula.

Now, the inclusion of gliding is very good and I really hope it stays, it feels as though it has been pulled straight from Pilotwings 3D! the underwater sections don't really add a lot to the overall experience, but I wouldn't complain if they ever returned. The ONLY problem with this game is its character roster, it doesn't feel like it has enough, 17 in all, and its missing a couple of Mario Kart essential characters (WALUIGI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and Baby Mario), don't get me wrong, the characters that are there are all good (yes, I don't mind the Honey Queen or Metal Mario) but it's just oddly missing the two characters I've already mentioned. And for that reason Mario Kart 7 is on about the same level of awesomeness as Wii, but 7 probably just edges it in fairness. If you own a 3DS, buy Mario Kart, it's one of those games that you'll still be playing a few years down the line, it won't disappoint!… Expand",

For once though, the rubber band AI is slightly 'toned down'; a more hardcore experience for the fans (and still accessible for casual gamers as well)",

The coin system is allso interesting, you can get coins to speed you up more but it is only a small increase in the speed and coins contribute to some unlocks.\rAlthough I don't think that half the game should be retro courses, I reckon it'd be better is there is only 4-6 of them.\rThe multiplayer either online or locally worked amazingly and had to be the best multiplayer out of all of the Mario Kart games. Although the friend code system can be a bit tedious and would be better if only one person needed to add you then you get a notification saying if you want to add them or not would be a lot better. Other than that it works quite well.\rIt is quite sad that they removed the VS mode where you can just race against CPU's as practice for Grand Prix's you can still use VS mode in multiplayer with a friend, but even without the VS mode for singleplayer I still enjoyed it a lot, even though there can be a bit of coin grinding here and there.\rOne final thing; the Streetpass/Spotpass features are quite good, you can race against people you saw online with their ghosts and people you pass by in Streetpass if they have the game and you can do other things too.\rOverall great game and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who'd like to try out a racing game for the 3DS or is a fan of Mario.… Expand",

A ten out of ten means a perfect execution of concepts with no visible flaws, and that's exactly what MK7 is. This entry has the best physics, the best track design, the best balance and the best controls. Instead of breaking down the pros and cons, I will simply dissect the pros due my lack of conviction in the existence of any flaws. The overall presentation: it's essentially Mario Kart Wii, very similar menus and layout. This is idea, as Mario Kart Wii had the best layout and menus of any Mario Kart game. The online menus and functionality is also largely identical to MKWii, except with a few new features like communities or groups or whatever they're called, I wasn't terribly interested in that kind of stuff. The real meat and potatoes are the raw elements, and this where the game is unstoppable. The tracks in this entry were designed in collaboration with Retro Studios, who if you are not familiar are among the most consistently fantastic level designers in the world. MK7 does not disappoint. Tracks are sharp, engaging, surprising, and layered. The new layers often come in the form of aquatic and aerial sections in which you race in floaty underwater physics or very different hang gliding segments. I cannot stress how much these new sections actually add to the game. On the surface they may strike you as simply being minor distractions, until you discover that you can pull off absurd drifting techniques underwater and that your technique in the air allows you to create your own little shortcuts, soaring past foes on the ground with the right movements through the air and evasion of obstacles. When the tires hit the road again, it's Mario Kart at it's finest. The silky-smooth controls, performance and surprisingly slick circle pad leave every element of manipulation behind. I found myself completely immersed and engaged with the experience, as I frantically evaded green shells, made breath-stopping drifts along the edges of demise in Neo Bowser City and exploited nifty and treacherous shortcuts on Wuhu Island (but no glitching, shame on you!). The drifting is, I guess for a lack of better term, deep and satisfying. The items are all over the place and constantly bring the random chaos to the table while still allowing skill to be the defining pillar in your success....almost all the time.  The 3D effect is both profound and subtle. It's essentially perfect, because it doesn't distract or define the experience but adds something foundational to the experience. It's kind of a paradox. I really like the 3D and use it 100% of the time with very little strain or discomfort, and I often have both of those problems with 3D. So in short: use it. The Characters and karts are all largely the same as before except now you can swap out tires with your kart, it's not terribly exciting but does allow for greater customization over your ride than any other Mario Kart which lends itself to more strategies than before, like taking advantage of the \"off-road\" portions of the track design which is more pronounced in this iteration than any other. Another aspect of the track design that I found fun were the single-lap super tracks, adding some variety and a new spin on rainbow road, the rainbow road in MK7 is also the best version yet with more layers to its design. Overall, I can only attempt to recommend this game enough to any fan of racing games or Mario Kart. There's certainly a sensation of deja-vu coming off of Mario Kart Wii, but the execution is in top form. The worst thing I can say about Mario Kart 7 is that it makes all the other ones irrelevant.… Expand",

First of all, i'm one of those guys who - of all Mario Kart games - liked Mario Kart 64 the most. I'm not a big fan of Mario Kart Wii, nor Mario Kart Double Dash (worst MK-Game in my eyes). Mario Kart DS was ok, but not at the same level Mario Kart 64 was back in the days. I'm sayin all that stuff to show that i was very sceptical at the beginning about this game. I seen the Trailers and the new stuff and thought that it could only go two ways: (A) Be very dissapointing OR (B) A welcomed upgrade to a legendary Kart racing game that made my childhood very entertaining when wheather wasn't the greatest and i had to stay at home. After several hours of playing this game i decided it was (B). The game has what made Mario Kart 64 so popular and didn't take stuff into the game that made other Mario Kart games terrible. It's the best Mario Kart in my opinion. So... jeah, i know i said Mario Kart 64 was the legend of all Mario Karts but this game is even better. My initial scepsis about the new stuff like cruisin' under water or flying in the air dissapeared really fast and transformed into the point that this is the stuff that makes this game so special and adorable. Another thing i noticed are some \"balance\" changes.In Mario Kart DS it was possible to drive past the courses like a snake to get infinite boosts and even though u didn't drive the shortest possible route, u was faster than your opponents because u was always on that boost-mode. Asians were the most common guys to play like this. Mario Kart 7 cut that corner. It's not possible any more. Drifting is still a big part about this game, but its not faster to drive on a straight route like an S looks and be faster than a guy who just takes the shortest possible way. Conclusion: The graphics look sharp, the animations are great, the new items make sense and last but not least the courses are beautiful and great to play on. Hell yeah, even the hated \"Rainbow Boulevard\" isn't such a dissapointing route like it was on Mario Kart Wii. This game is the best Mario Kart u can get for money and the online mode is working very well too. To be honest i can't even think about a single bad thing in this game.Thanks Ninetndo, you brought the game back to a guy who thought the series died after Mario Kart 64.… Expand",

Game play has gotten the addition of gliders and underwater driving, both of which do feel like a nice change from the usual driving experience in previous games. Both allowed me to find alternate routes and even some shortcuts, so they really do work. The kart handling in these areas do vary with different combinations, some will work better than others, but the experience is satisfying. My only problem with these two features is that on a few of the tracks they do feel pretty useless, like the underwater driving on N64 Koopa Beach. Otherwise, they are cool new additions that don't screw up the game play. The single player offering is solid with the usual circuit racing, battle mode, and time trials. The new tracks are colorful and creative, and do offer their own sort of challenge to the game, like Music Park and the new Rainbow Road. Retro tracks are also nice and utilize the new track add-ons effectively, for the most part. Battle mode is decent, but I wished the new courses actually had some gliding and underwater driving. In spite of that all the tracks are pretty cool, too. Plus, collecting data via Streetpass can get you another person's ghosts and their own created Grand Prix, which is an interesting versus mode-like way to play. While it doesn't have the options of Vs. mode, if you like the tracks in this game, then the custom Grand Prix will be an enjoyable experience. Multiplayer mode is amazing, especially the online, which is really the best so far. The ability to play in communities with set rules is a nice change from just entering random matches. You can also play against registered friends, past opponents, and people you've met by way of Streetpass as another way to join a game. I was even able to see my record against them and even what mode they where playing in (Battle or Race). That, along with very little lag, no hackers, and the patch to fix glitch abuse on some of the tracks makes this a big improvement in the online department. As for the local multiplayer it is just as good as what the DS version offered, and I found no problems with that either. The items have been toned down, and some were taken out (like the POW block) to scale back the luck element, and take my word for it: it's for the best. The new items also don't feel too over-powered. The Lucky 7 is very useful and not frequent, the Fire Flower can be annoying at times, but is a great projectile weapon, and the Tanooki Tail is good for close-combat and defense as long as you're patient with it. I was only annoyed by the Blue Shell's ability to roll me to a side, although it rarely threw me off the track and I do feel like that complaint is being over-blown by some people. The game itself does lean towards pure racing rather than luck so that better drivers will finish higher most of the time, which is great for the serious gamers. The sound is superb, with many catchy tunes for each course, and the character voices didn't annoy me a lot either. Graphics are great for the platform and the 3D effect is nice to look at as well. Section tracks were a cool new feature, kart customization is simple, but not too streamlined, and the first-person view with gyro controls works surprisingly well. The only problem with gyro controls is that you are using them on a handheld, so it will feel awkward at first. The character list is pretty good, even though they did take out some popular ones from past games, and the character list size of 17 is actually not that bad for a 3DS game. Sense of speed in this game is pretty nice for a Mario Kart game, and not too boring. They did bring back coins to increase speed and unlock new kart parts, which is also nice to aim for in a race. The tweaks to the game may be conservative, but Mario Kart is at the point where the core elements have been so tampered with, that they have found the right spot in this game.\rAll-in-all, this game is excellent. I do wish the single-player offering was a little deeper, the characters choices a little better, and the new battle tracks a bit more inspired, but those are really just minor problems. Multiplayer is better than ever, tracks are great, game play is well-done, and the game is fun all-around. Must-own if you have a 3DS or are a fan of Mario Kart.… Expand",

                "After playing all the cups at least one, and some of the early ones a few more times with out kart configurations, quick synopsis of this latest Mario Kart is that it is tentatively brilliant.\r The first obvious change when start racing is the feel. It's closer to the Wii version with the sliding. There's no left-right wiggle as with the DS version; you hold the slide as long as possibleAfter playing all the cups at least one, and some of the early ones a few more times with out kart configurations, quick synopsis of this latest Mario Kart is that it is tentatively brilliant.\r The first obvious change when start racing is the feel. It's closer to the Wii version with the sliding. There's no left-right wiggle as with the DS version; you hold the slide as long as possible to build the boost. Most obvious is that it feels so sluggish to the DS. There you can flick the kart all over the place. Also, driving on dirt kills you! It slows you down so much and can barely steer. This is where the \"monster\" tyres come in, if you choose to select. Obviously you lose general handling and acceleration.\r Equally with the Wii, tracks are quite elaborate, and seem generally brilliant. Need more time to decide - to see how they cope in full race mode once familiarity sets, push karts and tracks to their limits. Already it seems they have a good learning curve to really excel, especially with the karts with lesser handling and acceleration.\r Also new is when you hop at the crest of a jump, you get a small boost on landing. I believe something similar in Wii where you'd waggle for a trick. Works really well in 3DS.\r The glider addition works well. By hopping off jumps and angling the glide, allows some strategy in gliding, whether diving for coins, or creating lift to clear sections of track.\r The 3D is good. I use it all the time. Of course, it's not necessary to enjoy the game.\r Difficulty is much the same as other MKs - ie: easy! In my first go (150cc), I played all new cups for a 1st (two attempts), 1st, 3rd & 4th. On retro cups, did first two for 1st & 1st. A friend defeated both final cups on first attempt, the retro one winning all races. He owned Wii MK so was able to adapt easily to the handling. He raced with high acceleration and handling configuration. The big advice with the difficulty is to use heavier karts and fatter tyres - ie: reduce acceleration and handling. That, along with using a fatter character, will substantially increase the challenge. I've made this my personal challenge to defeat the game on standard kart and wheels. So far, in about 7 attempts, racing on the first 3 new cups, not even close to winning any.\r Best of all with MK7, standard MK cheapness is there. Meaning that while often it seems unfair, it never is. Racing to hold of the hoard and even winning against the odds, it's still so satisfying. Remember also that tables will turn. One race I was leading for most of the last lap, then got hammered with blue shell and fireballs, dropping to 7th. I was furious. Then picked up a lightning and glided over in first. If there's some criticisms, it's is that the fake item is no longer part of your arsenal. While 16 new and 16 old tracks sounds nice, why not 20 new and 60 old? Even easier, why not tracks to be raced in reverse (not mirror). Sure some will need jumps or zippers to make them work. So! Add it. That immediately doubles the tracks available. Also, how about a track creator like Mod Nations Racer? My only hope is that Nintendo will add this in time. At least DLC for new tracks. This fascist way that Nintendo works has bothered me for years. As the review says here, custom options should be any combination of items, not just a single item. I'd love to set triple-reds and tails in a custom race. Why can't I?\r Other changes are all positive. Gone is the horrible POW weapon introduced for Wii that knocked out everyone ahead of you. Add to the fact the grid is back to 8 racers from 12, it means for a far more fluid race.  New weapons include the Tanooki Tail to whip nearby karts and block weapons, and a Fire Flower that allows shooting fireballs forwards or backwards. Both are great. The Lucky 7 (7 items all out your disposal) surprisingly doesn't over-power the game. In fact, often they are not all used for you lose them from someone else's attack.\r The next test is the online and just see how the game really excels and its overall balance - because the multi-player is the true measure of the game. While I rate MK DS as easily the best of the series, it was plagued with the \"snakers\" that could turbo-wiggle the entire course. The revised sliding method on MK7 means that MK7 has potential to be at least a close second if the balance no adverse exploitation is there. Right now, two friends that swore off buying a 3DS and MK7 already see the potential. One has bought the game and a 3DS with the other very much considering it.… Expand",

The game consists of 13 characters with 5 of which being unlockable. The starting line up of 8 characters you get when you first start the game consists of Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Princess Peach Toadstool, Kinopio Toad, Koopa Troopa, Donkey Kong (previously known as Donkey Kong Jr. in the SNES title, his father being Donkey Kong Sr./Cranky Kong from the Donkey Kong arcade game) and King Bowser Koopa which is the exact same cast as Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Famicom. The main gameplay gimmicks consist of performing tricks off of ramps with the R button to gain speed boosts, gathering coins to gain small boosts and slightly increase top speed and acceleration but the benefit maxes out at 10 coins, utilizing a glider and propeller to guild yourself around both in the air and in the water respectively, using drift boosts to speed up, and finally for the first time ever in a Mario Kart game, the ability to switch between First Person and Third Person driving views. For the first time in the Mario Kart Series since Mario Kart 3: Super Circuit for Gameboy Advanced there is two Rainbow Road tracks available for selection. Two mechanics, Drafting which has been significantly empowered and Drift Boost which have been significantly nerfed return however the Snaking concept which was a popular use of the drift boost mechanic in Mario Kart 5: DS for significantly increasing speed seems to be next to impossible to pull off thanks to the new game mechanics. The Single Player offline experience has been significantly minimized since Mario Kart DS mostly due to the Mission Mode and VS Mode being dropped leaving only Gran Prix Mode, Time Trials Mode, Balloon Battle Mode and Coin Runners Mode as the only single player modes. On the other hand, the Multiplayer modes have had a major content upgrade, Wireless play and Download play give you access to all tracks and far more content than in its DS prequel. Wifi modes consists of 2-8 player racing and battling, you can also create personalized community server groups with your own personal rules and game modes that can be accessed by a password code and later saved to a favourites list for later easy access. Once a day get a download of various content to your Mario Kart 7 channel (if connected to Wifi) such as ghost data to race against in single player and various other challenges and activities leaving you with some replay value for offline single player play. In online you now have a Virtual Ranking score (VR) as well as a win and loss list.Your VR increases if you place in the higher ranks, it decreases if you disconnect during a race and it stays the same if you place low. People that you meet in wifi races will be recorded so you can track them if you want a rematch and their information also added to Mii Plaza and games with similar features like Super Mario Land 3D.

                "Although each year's Call of Duty has always been a package deal, Black Ops II represents a watershed moment. It's bulging at the seams, not only because nearly every team that's ever worked on Call of Duty has had a hand in it. The engine has been tweaked, multiplayer and CODcasting are both revolutionary, single-player has a decent lifespan and offers more than the same roller-coaster but on a tougher difficulty setting, while Zombies is mental comic relief. [Christmas 2012, p66]", 
                "Black Ops II isn't a revelation; what you'll play here is largely what you've played before. There's simply so much to play, though, that it's impossible to deny that Treyarch has finally given us a Call on par with the best of 'em.", 
                "Call of Duty: Black Ops II is the best shooter of 2012, and also one of the best games overall.", 
                "We're not sure if this is the best Call of Duty of this generation, but we're convinced Treyarch has produced the most complete one since the first Modern Warfare.", 
                "No matter how much you oppose Call of Duty and its publisher (or even the FPS genre), you can't deny the powerhouse that Black Ops II is. Three humongous modes, each complementing the others perfectly. That's right: three whole modes.[December 2012, p.56]", 
                "An interesting blend. It consists of everything I expected to see and a few things I didn't, the latter of which surprised me. I can't say the Strike Force missions were a good idea but at the very least, they're a departure from the norm. And the addition of player choice is definitely a plus. As for the rest, the high production values, Hollywood-esque presentation, relatively intriguing campaign, and a multiplayer that delivers on all counts, it's hard to say this year's CoD falls short. Some can say the multiplayer is too similar but hey, this is Call of Duty. The fans know what they like by now.",

Final run down is there has been some touch ups done on graphics, though not enough to be noticeable to any huge degree; whatever it lacks in overall graphic pizzazz, it more than makes up for in the fun factor. Touch ups have been done on the Prestige system and perks as well.",

                "Though zombies mode is stagnating and the novel new social features are a flop, the rest of Black Ops II is lively and entertaining, and it's great to see some shifting in the familiar structure.", 
                "Taken as a whole, Black Ops II is excellent value despite a hefty RRP. The campaign is genuinely replayable thanks to the branching plot and some truly memorable levels, and the multiplayer trumps that of every other Call of Duty, providing the series' most comprehensive customisation system yet alongside a newcomer-friendly matchmaking system that doesn't ignore the hardcore.",

                "Though the single-player campaign is far from a strong point of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 due to its clumsy narrative, ill-judged sections and short length, the online multiplayer still hits all of the right targets. Some crucial changes ensure that it's a decent fit for a range of skill levels and more flexible than before, and the Zombies mode has been improved once again. It might not fire on all cylinders, but as a multiplayer game, Black Ops 2 is still in the upper ranks.", 
                "Black Ops 2, in thematic solidarity with the sacrifices of its protagonists, will likely not be remembered among the best of its brethren. And yet, the best Call of Duty installments yet to come will succeed because of the work that Treyarch has done here."

There's a new Pick 10 class system where you can pick a combination of 10 weapons, perks, attachments, lethals/tacticals, and wildcards. And the \"Killstreaks\" are now \"Scorestreaks\". Zombies - 9/10. Zombies are just like before, but better. There is a new TranZit mode, where its a huge world where you ride a bus and go to different locations to find parts to build different things. Then there is Grief, which is like regular Survival, but there are 2 teams instead of the regular 1. Last team standing wins. Now there is also custom Zombies, where you can choose different options like: which round to start on (1, 5, 10, 15, or 20), Hellhounds, headshots only, and a few others. Overall - 8/10.

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nWhen I first got black ops 2, I wasn't sure what to expect, for black ops was in my opinion the most entertaining COD not particulary with the campaign, but with the multiplayer, I thought treyarch did a wonderful job in that aspect. However, after reading these reviews I was expecting a horrible game that wasted all the money spent on it. Ill start off with the multiplayer, and yes like all other call of duty's, it was great and easy to use, especially with the new addition of pick 10. I admit it was frustrating in the beginning as I was unsure of what guns to use and how to create the perfect class, but that soon changed. Too add to that, the addition of league play is super fun as well as the other small things such as providing cooler clan tags which are fun and challenging to unlock. And the future weapons are amazing as they are not sci-fi crazy futuristic, but futuristic enough to believe that they could possibly be created in the near future. All that aside I give the multiplayer an 8/10. Now onto the campaign. It was amazing and that's all there is to it, from the slow motion action scenes in night clubs whilst dubstep/electronin music blares in the background to playing as the bad guy (menendez) running through a town ferociously killing everybody with a machete to protect his sister! Plus who would of thought Alex Mason would of died the way he did!! Again I admit, that the campaign does have its weak points in that the beginning was slow and almost painful to get through, yet I feel it was necccasary to propel the story!! Plus the addition of choice on who you kill or whether you kill or injure a character is fantastic!! It was action packed, with a compelling story that made me sad to finish in the end, yet it was beautiful, thus in the end ill give it a 9/10. Lastly there is zombies, and although I cant say much on this as I have never played it as much, I can say that so far it is interesting and again a fun new take on the game type, but ill get back to it once I play it more! So in the end although it does have its lows, I feel that this game is amazing, and possibly one of the best call of duty's made!! I recommend you buy it and enjoy!… Expand",

But I am going to base it off of what I've seen so far, which is the full campaign and several hours of multiplayer.  First of all, let's stop comparing this to MW3.  The two are not truly comparable.  Second, let's look at what makes a game good: Depth, replayability, completeness...  The story line was excellent, as it gives you a chance to make your own choices, which is new to a CoD campaign.  It avoids the complexity of an RPG, which is what the cod series has done on purpose to focus more on multiplayer.  The zombies is more complicated than ever, which adds a challenge, but I think another kino map is needed with less complexity just to balance it out (for those who liked to run in circles until round 100).  Next, replayability: the game has infinite replayability on multiplayer: even if the playerbase ends in 10 or so years, a person can still play against AI in combat mode.  Ok.  Let's look at the multiplayer.  Gamers need to keep an open mind:  I like to explain the gameplay like a cross between BO1 and Homefront.  The lower but still good scorestreaks are decently easy to get, so everyone can feel good when they play, and the better players can go for the higher scorestreaks while forced to play the objective to do so, since more points are given for doing that than just being a mercenary.  The pick 10 create-a-class is an ingenius addition alone -- one of the best they could have made.  The maps are decently balanced as far as I've seen.   Completeness:  Obviously, the developers could have spent more time on it, but the fans demand so much in so little time, that I think that they delivered what they could in relatively excellent quality.\r If you look at this like a standalone game without prequels, then it's pretty darn good.  Let's keep in mind that call of duty is a revolutionary concept, and this game truly added to the original while keeping a lot of it's aspects.  Let's not be so harsh - go hate on other games that have real problems and not just (pardon the term) 'nooby' players.… Expand",

However, the perks and weapons are pretty balanced and they did a good job there.\r Then there is zombies, which is what I bought it for actually. Huge dissapointment. The tranzit mode is kind of fun, yes, but its far too complicated compared to BO1. There are no good spots to walk in circles and just shoot them up like in Der Riese or Ascension. The maps Town, Bus depot and Farm are flat out HORRIBLE. There is lava everywhere, bus depot doesn't have any perks, no wonder weapons, it's overly crowded and in Farm you can't see more than 2 meters in front of you because of all the mist. The lava sets you on fire every second. If you love WaW/BO1 zombies DO NOT BUY THIS. It's really horrible.\r The campaign is okay, just okay.

Every level felt unique, with some interesting locales on show; there are multiple paths you can take to reach your goal, and you have a veritable plethora of weapons to choose from at the beginning of each mission, some real, some fictional. Something else that stood out for me was the music; it actually felt like -shock horror- video game music! A far cry from the soulless, generic orchestras of Modern Warfare. There is one segment in particular - I won't spoil anything - that feels more like Doom than Call of Duty, and it's one of the best levels in the entire series.\r The story is above and beyond the normal Call of Duty fare. It explores the themes of over-reliance on technology, how blindly following orders can lead to tragedy, and the foolishness of disproportionate revenge. The main antagonist, Raul Menendez, is a genuinely sympathetic character, though it's clear he's gone off the deep end somewhere down the line. As a matter of fact, the entire cast is pretty colourful apart from one character; the main character, David Mason, is a bit of a milquetoast. It doesn't really feel like he has a personality beyond \"Dad died, I'm sad now ;___;\". During the course of the campaign the game offers you several choices, some of which aren't immediately apparent. This is an interesting experiment in FPS game design, and honestly it does this better than any \"choice-based RPG\" released in the past decade.\r I'm not going to talk about multiplayer and zombies much, because I think at it's core Black Ops 2 was intended as a single player game, but here goes. Multiplayer is fun, but it gets boring fast. The new Pick Ten system is a great addition, and League Play ups the ante as far as skill level goes, the new scorestreak system is a vast improvement, but apart from that you'll get what you'd expect from Call of Duty. Shootin' dudes. Zombies I feel lacks a sense of focus; Tranzit just isn't as fun as the previous maps, though Grief Mode is interesting. The new characters aren't as funny as the old cast, but maybe they'll develop them further somewhere down the line.\r To finish, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is an excellent game, if we're talking about the campaign.

I would like to start this review by saying to all of you who rated this game horribly: errrrm, what? It's the exact same as the past four bloody Call Of Duty games. The thing that makes Blops 2 stand out is that it's developed by Treyarch. Treyarch always seems to find a way to fit in that extra oomph that Call Of Duty needs, making a more interesting and varied experience each year. Now let's look at Infinity Ward... they, of course, made the Modern Warfare series (I vomited in my mouth a little when I said that...) which displays zero innovation every year it is released, and at the same time finds a way to make you hate every character that's in the series in their own special way. But enough rambling about Modern Warfare. Let's get to Black Ops 2.\r I'd like to start with the single player campaign for this review. The single player of Call Of Duty has always been a conflicting area for me. It's usually not good, which gets you a wee bit mad whenever you look at that missing spot where your 60 bucks used to be. At the same time, most people don't buy Call Of Duty games for the campaign, and the devs don't expect you to do so. Multiplayer has always been the focus of CoD. While this game aims to fix some of the problems, which it does so in a reasonable fashion, it also attempts to add an arse load of new unique content. This is an effort that has not been put into CoD for a long time, since Call Of Duty 3 I'd say. This game adds true innovation that hasn't been seen in Call Of Duty for a long time. Another \"innovation\" of this game is that it has an OK story! Whilst hunting for Menendez, you truly feel like there is a reason to hunt him down. The characters are basic and static, but they're likable enough to want to know what happens next on their path. But enough with the story, yo wants to knows about dem's dying! Yes... so due to Call Of Duty's thrown up and recycled version of ID Tech, the shooting is what you would expect from a Call Of Duty game: nice, easy shooting for a casual shooter fan. The shooting does feel a bit better in this game with the subtle addition of a hit marker in Single Player, which I love. The biggest change to Single Player would be the ability to change your loadout before each and every mission. This is also, in my opinion, the BEST change to CoD I've seen in recent years. If you develop a favorite weapon over the course of the campaign, don't worry! As long as you've made it far enough or completed the right challenge, you can use whatever weapon you please! There's not much more to say about the campaign. Like all CoD campaigns, but with some interesting changes and moments that make it worthwhile to finish. There is limited replay-ability if you want to get the best ending for the cap on the Black Ops series.\r And now... for the Multiplayer. It's essentially Modern Warfare's multiplayer on steroids. Like most CoD games, it displays no innovation of any description. This version shows \"deinnovation\" (if it's not a word, it is now!) with the multiplayer. Treyarch decided to go back to Modern Warfare weapon level system, whereby you must level up certain weapons in order to get attachments and camo for said weapon. Look, I'm fine with this system, unlocking weapons in order makes logical sense, and camo is nothing but cosmetic. But attachments is where I draw the line. Let's make a scenario here. I'm a level 31, no prestige. I decide I want to switch my custom class's weapon from a PDW to an MP7. I got the idea from using an MP7 with EDTech in the campaign. I get the MP7, then realize I must be a weapon level 13. I proceed to launch myself from my 2-story window. The thing that peeves me most about this, is that the scopes you use do not have an effect on your skill level. It all comes down to personal preference. I can say, for a fact, that none of the scopes are overpowered in any way. It just comes down to what your favorite scope is. Mine personally is a PDW with no scope, fast mag and a suppressor. Again, that's my preference. I couldn't have that if I just started to use a new weapon. Grrr... they should have just stuck with the CoD points system...\r I won't go into Zombies, it's exactly like the old zombies. I feel they removed some of the character from it by taking out distinguishable characters, but it's still an extremely fun game mode.\r Overall, Black Ops 2 is a worthy successor to its previous title, if a bit less imaginative. Still, if you're a Call Of Duty fan, or even if you're not, you still will enjoy yourself with this game's refreshing casual and easy shooting style. Plus, there's not much you can do if you give this game a bad rating. Treyarch will be laughing all the way to the bloody bank with their biggest commercial release of 2012.… Expand",

The voice-acting is also still great and it's nice to see the continued character story-arc from BO with Woods, Mason, Hudson etc. and now continuing with Mason's son and co. However the story isn't quite up to scratch with the few other COD's I've played and it can be a little confusing when it switches from one level in the past to another in the future and so on, yet it can be forgiven because it ties in with the main villain's life who is definitely one of the best COD has ever seen since he seeks vengeance and you really get understand his motives. Also an addition to the campaign and a change to the series is player-choices in some of the levels which affect the outcome of the game, as well as Strike Force missions which can be slightly annoying and tricky to pull off. The choices however increase the replay value and its nice to see what your actions caused at the end of the campaign. Graphics wise, it's much the same as its always been yet still attractive and gameplay is still simple. For the multiplayer, I have to say I really got stuck into this (although I have hardly played any of the other CODs) and it has great customization for weapons etc, and while I can see zombies is improved I never play it.

This time though, coming from the disappointed experience (for me) of the latest Medal of Honor I was in desperate need of a new FPS also considering that less and less people are playing MW3 online.\rAnyway I went and bought BO2 and this is what I think:\r1) Single: personally I don't mind the jumping back and forth in time as I don't know the characters hence for me it is all new. I can understand people who have played the first BO not liking it. Difficulties are not too high and I would have liked a little less \"help\" witht he aiming, lots of time I found myself missing a shot on purpose just to see my enemy drop dead.\r2) Multiplayer: well for my taste not good as it goes against everything I like in a FPS game, meaning \"think before you act\". This game is a sheer quick run and shoot. Maps are pretty small and it gives also lots of (too many) opportunities for people to just camp (that is what most annoyed me in MoH).\r3) Overall Game: a) Graphics: personally they do look bad and dated. I mean after playing Battlefield 3 the bar has been set really high (another reason why I dislike MoH which even though uses the same engine as BF3 it been tuned down multiple notches). b) Sound: simple awful. I mean the \"puff\" the guns make when shooting is to my ears light year away from the sound of guns. And what about the comments you hear your character make when for instance you kill someone? Really? Who talks like that and why would you do that? Just a way to boost the ego of the player.\rc) Approach: in 2012 almost 2013 I would like to see more logic applied behind how things work. Starting from how guns respond when firing (e.g. sway). This is where MoH has done a good job even though they manage to mess it up in the single player going a bit too extreme. Also how the environment responds to bullets and explosion could be done better. Besides the usual vehicle blow up, windows smashing and plywood cracking there is little else.\rFinal Comments: for me this game is ok to play if you can miss the 60 Euros (live in a Euro country) otherwise if you are torn between 2 games and you only got 60 euros I would say don't buy BO2.\rIf the both franchises behind the COD title don't come up with serious changes in the game I don't think I will buy the next chapter. It's been a nice game but now the frustration I get out of it is greater than the pleasure.\rWhishes: my next FPS should be something like BF3 in terms of graphics and \"logics\" but without all those vehicles.

Black Ops 2 has a great campaign mode writen by David Goyer who helped write the Dark Knight. The storyline is clever although not the standout if the game. The game sees even brighter light with the Multiplayer. It's as good as it's ever been and added some new designs for good measure. The zombie mode, seemed like a flop due to the dissaperence of the original characters, but, zombies changed to much it makes it all worth it. Tranzit is the highlight of zombies, showing off the new made \"Greenrun\" and a whole new direction for Call of Duty. This is as good as the original Black Ops which I gave an 8/10. Well done, Treyarch.… Expand",

What mildly intelligent person actually cares about the relentless barrage of trophies and medals which remain as completely useless mementos locked away in the dark quarters of your console. Receiving a trophy does not make a game fun. Playing the game should be all the fun needed. COD is not fun. I started up the single player campaign to be blown away by the complete lack of 3D during cinematics. To clarify i have just finished AC3 in 3D and the 3D was awesome, the game, so so. Then the game finally started, thought id get my kill on. Instead i was left feeling sick by the poorly programmed 3D in the game. OK, i'll play without 3D then (dissapointing since 3D games are few and far between). I thought maybe i would stop feeling sick now. I was wrong. The urge to bring up breakfast, lunch and possibly dinner from the night before was simply to great. You see i am a sympathetic vomiter, i see vomit, i vomit. What was being served up on my beautiful 1080P 63\" 3D TV was indeed vomit. The graphics are worse than bad. I can hear all you braindead fanboys now, \"it runs at 60fps...how can it be bad when so many people buy it?...\" Well first of all, in case you hadnt noticed, nobody cares about 60fps, as long as it can hold a steady frame rate of say 30fps and not stutter it is perfectly acceptable even imperceptible, ie BF3 which incidentally craps all over CODBO1 & 2. \"Why do so many people buy it?\" Easy. People are idiots! One need only walk down the street and witness a slew of teenage boys wearing their little sisters jeans with hair that must having taken all morning to style to understand this. More evidence you ask. Look at those that sit atop society in any region of the world, they are always a minority, why you ask again. Because people are overwhelmingly idiots. Back to COD. I am not a hater, honestly i want all games to be fun. I've been gaming for like 25 years, i do not discriminate. So where did my CODBO2 story end?? I was so disillusioned with gaming after just 10 mins of CODBO2 ( I know your thinking, \"well you didn't even play it, you missed the options and story line blah blah blah zombies blah blah\") I didn't and wont miss anything. If i want to be bored and have options that lead to different endings i'll read one of my old chose your own adventure novels. If i want zombies I'll watch The Walking Dead (which is awesome BTW). So... I digress. After attempting to play and ending up heaving in the toilet i was depressed. I thought to myself i cant wait until the end of the month for Far Cry 3 or more importantly the end of the year for more expansions for BF3. I need to have my new found hatred of games quashed. Now i must tell you that i have never owned an XBOX always PC games and Playstations. I did the only thing i could. I bought a XBOX and Halo 4 and whilst is very far from the greatest game ive played, it has all but erased the sour taste left by CODBO2.

In my experience, I played League, Core, Hardcore, and the Nuketown playlist along with one of the party games.  I noticed that the more I try to think and deliberate with decision making in the game, my success rate goes down in a match.  I had more success when I was paying attention to videos on my laptop and habitually moving the analog sticks and pulling trigger buttons lazily.  In my opinion, this the equivalent to what's known as a \"button-masher\" in the fighting or beat-em-up genre (sometimes even 3rd person action adventure).  It's fun with friends, but it is not very challenging to a someone who wants to approach a game with an independent mind.  The guns might as well shoot out laser beams or magic spells because their is virtually no recoil.  I mostly used the Skorpion EVO, m7, MTA, SCAR H, and Chicom CQB.  In my opinion, the gunplay lacks the personality that MW3 had, but I did not put as many hours in BO2 as MW3.  It is just my impressions.  Last night I found myself playing the game I really felt disgusted and disappointed with the experience I was having.  It did not provide any sense of accomplishment in gaining kills.  I didn't feel as if I had earned success because of any ability that I possessed.  The series seems to have changed from a game of survival (COD4 & WOW) to an arcade party (MW2) to, now, a digital playground of chaos and disruption.  I mean, when you look at the game screen sometimes, you must ask yourself, \"what is this really that is taking place place in front of me?\"  Is it entertainment or amusement or simply an unorganized mess?\"  That is referring to what appears on screen, not necessarily mechanics.  The graphics have been polished and look a little more high-def compared to last year's MW3, but honestly, the characters and bright colors on the map are not very pleasing to the eye.   I had a problem with some of BF3's dry-looking, stale, gray maps for console, but this is not the remedy.  It's no wonder why they do live-action commercials with actors.  I just want to suggest to people who play the game or are interested in playing it, what is it that you actually value in your gaming experience?  Do you really find those values in this game?  I think the direction that treyarch took was to streamline, and organize the arcade madness that took place in previous titles in the series and squeeze it into a mechanical series of outrageous battles, but it backfired on them, making this an all out boring, sequence of fast-paced animations and magical guns.

On Veteran mode, it is literally impossible to win a strike force mission.

Two, you can't play because two minutes or so into the game, you get \"Connection Interrupted\" and get kicked out of the lobby. Three, you can't play because despite having high speed Internet, for some reason you always get a red 1-bar lag-tastic connection.

The lag compensation and hit detection in this game are worse than any of the three previous Call of Duty games (MW2, Black Ops 1, and MW3). It can be extremely frustrating to lose a gunfight to someone when, on your screen, you clearly should have come out on top. They have also taken away the ability to tie score-streaks to your custom classes, so if you find yourself struggling to win a gunfight due to lag or any other reason, you are stuck with the 3 score-streaks you chose and cannot switch to lower ones during a match. In addition to having horrible lag compensation and hit detection, the developers have implemented skill-based matchmaking, so even though the game has connection issues, players are not always placed in lobbies with the best ping. Often, players will be placed in games with worse connections in order to go up against players of similar skill level.\r TL;DR: the connection issues in this game have absolutely ruined it.

The multiplayer mode is what people buy this game for, or the Zombies mode. But I think most people don't really understand this game, and therefore think of it as a bad game. The new class setup for Black Ops 2 is a massive improvement from earlier games. Instead of just being leveling up for the sake of leveling up, it actually feels like it does have a point, and the point is obvious. When you level up, you both unlock more weapons and you get tokens you can use to be able to use these weapons. because there are only 55 levels, and you earn one token per level, you will not unlock everything in the game, which is a great thing. The main complaint that many people have with this game is the difficulty. The hit box for this game might seem a bit small compared to other games, but there is a reason for it. Call Of Duty: Black Ops 2 is the most complex and advanced tactical game out there right now. Because of the way that the class setup is made, the room for improvement is big, and you have endless of possibilities when it comes to customization. Every player has a role in Black Ops 2, and you'd be a fool not to realize yours. With a wide range of Score Streaks that are stackable with each other, tactics is very important here. Example: If your team is mainly consisting of people reaching for the objective, you can make their life easier by taking out enemies from a distance using Sniper Rifles, if you are one of the charging people, you can use smoke bombs and thermal sight to see through the smoke to capture flags more easily. You can also make good use of the perk system and wildcards to make the perfect assassin. Because of the point system and the wildcards, you can choose to discard all your weapons, put your points into wildcards and receive twice as many perks. With several perks for advanced movement, and a knife you become a deadly opponent. What I am trying to say is that, the multiplayer in itself is worth the $100 it costs for this game in Norway, and that the Single-player and the Zombies mode makes it even more so. The Zombies mode is good as usual, but not as good as Black Ops'. The Zombie maps are interestingly designed, but feels empty and sometimes quite boring. The single-player is good. It's not as boring as Black Ops, but not as good as Modern Warfare 2. Don't expect a good story, but the weapons are cool. The theme for Black Ops 2 is the future, and that is very apparent in the weapons. Some are very futuristic both in looks and in how they work (like the Kap-40) while others look like normal ones. The game is not quite like Halo in terms of the futuristic looks, but it is noticeable in both the maps and weapons. Overall this is a must buy game for all fans of shooters and Sci-fi, as it provides many many hours of fun.… Expand", 
                "I don't see why people hate this game so much. It's certainly not a bad game, but it's certainly not a great game. The story and the general themes seem quite racist, with every non-white character (apart from Tony Todd) betraying the pure, hard working white characters seems racist, as the idea of killing white people will make Treyarch run for their safety blanket. But the story seemsI don't see why people hate this game so much. It's certainly not a bad game, but it's certainly not a great game. The story and the general themes seem quite racist, with every non-white character (apart from Tony Todd) betraying the pure, hard working white characters seems racist, as the idea of killing white people will make Treyarch run for their safety blanket. But the story seems like it has some deeper meanings, as it has room for exploring the theme of unmanned military and how it greatly effects war, but most of the time it just wants you to lose yourself in shooty action xenophoby-fun. The bog-standard shooting remains intact and the level design has been changed up from 'run down this corridor, kill the under-privileged' to 'go down these optional, slightly non-linear paths and kill the under-privileged whilst also being able to optionally man turrets and drones'. The choices have been fleshed out pretty well too, even though they are made fully explicit. I  like how you can choose to shoot Tony Todd in the head or shoot him in the leg, but if you wait long enough the black guy will just knock him out for you. That's pretty neat. I like how the choices effect your future game, and it a great new take on a series established as being a linear conveyor-belt of linear linearity. The strike force missions are definitely the best part about the game and are heavily replayable, I just wish there were more of them. But I cannot praise competence as if it's excellence, as there have been more meaningful shooters that have come out this year that are generally more risky. Black Ops 2 is by all means safe, it doesn't try to challenge the player mentally, but is above average which is surprising because all other COD campaigns have been bog-standard at best. Overall, it's a refreshing game, and if you're a fan of multi-player shooters or zombie games, this is a must play. It's pretty much 3 passable games in one, and for $60, what more could you ask for?… Expand",

The Pick 10 system works very well and the weapons and futuristic equipment are fun to use. The new score streak system sort of works. To me, it's a smart move. But I don't think we're ever going to get rid of campers and people that just care about their K/D ratio. Last but not least: Zombies. Zombie mode is still a great as before. Really cool maps and they added some nice features, including the competitive 4v4 and there is more of an objective now.

The story however is uninteresting and the new protagonists are extremely boring and forgettable. Also the new strike force RTS segments have so much potential that is wasted with terrible friendly AI, thankfully these are mostly optional. The multiplayer has new ideas that in my opinion make it the most refined yet, but it feels way to similar to the other games which isn't really a problem as the games are fun but I got bored way faster than in the original black ops. As long as you're not expecting something completely fresh the multiplayer is still fun. The zombies mode was my favorite part of the original and this is the gamemode they've changed the most surprisingly. The zombies campaign treyarch promised is nothing more than a large map with a bus and build-able items which is somewhat disappointing but still fun. There are only three maps unless you get the special edition which is not too great considering these are just parts of the large tranzit map made into to small little arenas. The zombies mode is still fun but a little disappointing considering on how hyped up it was. Overall though this is still a fun package with hours of content and fun to be had.… Expand"

It does so many new things so very well, making it the most groundbreaking Call of Duty since the first Modern Warfare. Shooters simply don't get much more deep, varied, surprising, or rewarding than this.",

The \"ain't broke don't fix\" path has certainly been taken again.  This being said, Treyarch has undeniably been able to up the ante in nearly every facet of the Call of Duty experience with Black Ops 2.  The riveting single player storyline features the wonderfully-designed strategic Strike Force Missions; the online Multiplayer experience is much more robust than ever before and the Zombies mode has also received significant upgrades.  It is quite amazing how the development team managed to fit this much content onto one disk.  Needless to say, shooter fans can purchase Black Ops 2 with confidence.",

Throw in the hours' worth of addictive multiplayer and you have something that'll hook you well into the next generation.",

The multiplayer game is excellent, the expanded Zombies mode is an enjoyable and very welcome addition, and the single player campaign is a fun ride that will have you yelling \"Josephina!\" at random times for weeks to come. About the only miss is the addition of the Strike Force missions, but they don't drag down the overall experience with them.",

                "That Treyarch and Activision aren't just resting on their laurels, and are happy to inject new ideas into the experience, is something that should be rewarded by your interest.

                "This is the biggest movement in any direction we've seen from a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare - but unlike Infinity Ward's game changer, Black Ops 2 lacks a little in both the polish and conviction areas. It's going to be hard to go back to the same corridor shooters after Black Ops 2 - and it's going to be harder still for someone to convince me to play generic Team Deathmatch - but the game still feels like it falls short in some areas.", 
                "For shooter fans that don't require as deep of a dive, Black Ops II's multiplayer may feel like more of the same. No significant new match types are present, and the Pick 10 system doesn't drastically change the gameplay experience. Most of the changes to the Call of Duty formula come in campaign mode, and they are executed with mixed results. Despite some frustrations, Black Ops II is yet another massive, polished, finely tuned entry in a series that shows no signs of slowing down.",

                "It's a great game from a studio that's done everything it can with the tools at its disposal to reinvigorate Call of Duty, even if it doesn't refashion the series completely. You won't appreciate that just by playing its online mode, and you will be disappointed if you're wanting the property to be turned inside out and spun on its head. Those that simply love to play military first-person shooters, and were looking for something that finds what life is left in the genre, however, should find themselves perfectly catered to.", 
                "Black Ops II presents interesting backdrops and fine shooter action. The game hits its stride when it presents features that move beyond your traditional shooter, whether that be shooting at helicopters from horseback or diving out the back of a crippled plane.", 
                "Black Ops 2 isn't the game it could have been; there hasn't been enough change in the multiplayer mode. The game does offer an interesting single player experience and a cool zombie mode, unfortunately with dated graphics.", 
                "Ultimately though, a large portion of the experience still feels like a classic Call of Duty titles. We can't complain about it much, because no matter how many times you've played a game like this, each time you can't help but just enjoy the thrill of the ride, the vibrant new and impressive set-pieces and the adrenaline-pumping action.", 
                "This is not to say it's a bad game, it's just not different enough from previous Call of Duty titles. The story isn't memorable, the maps and weapons aren't any different to what we've previously experienced, the gameplay is near identical to previous games, and when it's not identical it falls flat and fails to impress.",

The team at Treyarch definitely feel like they are winning the race in terms of trying to bring innovation to the series compared to the very worn-out Modern Warfare franchise. The multiplayer experience is starting to feel old now, even with the fact that when you prestige you don't loose all your weapons. However with multiple endings for the campaign, Strikeforce missions, and an improved Zombie mode, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 was worth the wait and was an enjoyable game. The single player campaign is short at about 6 -8 hours, but there is plenty to keep people interested if they enjoy the multiplayer aspect of the game.", 
                "So if you're looking for an excuse to cave and buy yet another Call of Duty? Go ahead! There's enough new to explore and enjoy. But if you're tired of Call of Duty, that's what you're gonna get here, so don't bother feigning surprise when you're disappointed yet again.",

                "This game feels like Call of Duty which means its a good shooter. However it has some bugs and its innovative but not really innovative. Do you understand? Its a good shooter but its not the best game this year.", 
                "It's still very much a game rooted in past successes, but the bold changes it makes on the campaign side shows Treyarch aren't quite prepared to rest on their laurels.", 
                "All in all, Black Ops II is a solid game, but it feels kind of tired at this point in many respects. The new additions to the single player, zombie, and multiplayer components are a good effort, but they're not enough to transcend the series to a new level (like Halo 4 did for the Halo series). But if you enjoyed Black Ops, odds are you'll also enjoy Black Ops II - albeit a little less so.", 
                "Minor objections about design decisions aside, Black Ops II is another great shooter in a year of great shooters. It's a competent, confident, generous package, true to its core values, but with enough new to carve out its own identity, enough variety to appeal to a wide range of players, and enough content to belong on your shelf for more than just a quick playthrough. This is the way to do a yearly installment without just phoning it in.", 
                "Black Ops II might not be perfect, but the entertainment value far outweighs some questionable design choices.", 
                "Black Ops 2 is conflicted. It wants to move in bold new directions, but it falls back on safe, but aging, mechanics.", 
                "This is Call Of Duty, nothing more, nothing less. Fans of the series will lap it up, those who didn't like the previous games will not be swayed by anything it does. It has a target audience and Activision know what they want. Black Ops II doesn't disappoint, it just doesn't push the series on any further.", 
                "Call of Duty: Black Ops II continues the trend of a Michael Bay action film packed into a video game format. There's spectacle, voice talent, zombies, and finally a story with a good set up and player agency to boot. It may lack significant innovation, and the missions set in the 20th century are far from compelling story pieces, but with a robust multiplayer experience and a half-decent story, Black Ops II does the series proud.", 
                "Ultimately, ambition is the word that best describes Black Ops 2 - and that's remarkable enough in itself. This is still Call of Duty, with all that entails, and anyone who has resisted the series so far likely won't be won over this time either. For the fans, though, Black Ops 2 offers the rare sight of a series at its height choosing to experiment and change rather than stay loyal to a proven, but tired, formula.", 
                "Backed by Activision's fantastic investment and support, Treyarch has succeeded, and made a sort of ultimate current-gen Call Of Duty. Not a reinvention – that, hopefully, comes next year, on box-fresh hardware and a new engine – but a refinement of the most successful series of its generation. Black Ops II is an excellent Call Of Duty game, then, but it's only a Call Of Duty game, with all that implies.", 
                "Black Ops 2 is a good and complete Call of Duty-game. The Zombie-mode is once again very entertaining and the single player the best yet thanks to the moral choices it presents players with. The multiplayer still plays the same way after all these years, which makes sense, but is slightly disappointing for those who hoped that the new setting and structure would've caused it to change. All of the modes are a lot of fun though, but to enjoy it you'll have to bite through pretty outdated graphics.", 
                "It's hard to recommend Black Ops II to fans of story-based single player campaigns. Treyarch had problems connecting a story with strong characters, with a dynamic, linear shooter. The result is chaotic, but a mediocre single player mode cannot weigh heavily on a final opinion about this game. The most important thing in Black Ops II is an incredible multiplayer - a classic, fast-paced game with many innovations. The Pick 10 system opens up a metric ton of possibilities, and really good maps and play styles create a package never before seen in a Call of Duty game. If that's the thing you want in a modern shooter, you couldn't have picked better.", 
                "Don't make the mistake of confusing the near-future setting and the attempts at branching narrative for innovation. It's more like Treyarch has had a spring clean and got the decorators round: Black Ops II is still ostensibly built on the same foundations that powered 2008's Call of Duty 4 and every annual instalment of the series thereafter. The thrill of Call of Duty's rollercoaster ride is starting to diminish, then, but few will feel too short-changed by buying this year's ticket.", 
                "Treyarch did well in introducing Call of Duty to new approaches. The solo, especially, is surprisingly replayable thanks to story variations based on both player chance and performance. The multiplayer seems to have found the definitive system for custom classes with Pick-10, and the new Zombies mode called Tranzit offers new surprises and and open-world feeling that surely make it better. The graphics engine really starts to look old though, and the solo suffers from big plot holes, less polished scripting, and less spectacular sequences.", 
                "Overall Black Ops II is the most ambitious and innovative Call Of Duty for years, but it's also the most inconsistent. But that may well be the short term price for trying to do things differently.", 
                "Black Ops 2's campaign and Zombies mode are disappointments, especially coming off the across-the-board success of its predecessor...But it's a testament to the extraordinary quality of its multiplayer that Black Ops 2 won't go down as a forgotten entry.", 
                "Multiplayer is king in Black Ops 2, offering plenty of in-game and inherent rewards for its ravenous online community. It's paired with a lackluster story that fails the ambition shown by the branching campaign, reflecting the overall game's forward-thinking but imperfectly executed ideas.", 
                "The campaign hits the same satisfying rhythms, the multiplayer captures the same frenetic intensity, and the cooperative zombies mode delivers the same stale undead-massacring action. Caught between striving for the future and remaining rooted in the past, Black Ops II finds solid footing, providing another great ride on the Call of Duty rollercoaster.", 
                "As a multiplayer game, Black Ops 2 is one of the best shooters around - sprawling and sagging under the weight of interesting systems. Offline, however, it's merely adequate. Despite some commendable ambition, Black Ops 2 isn't quite the match-stealing assault on Infinity Ward's turf we hoped it would be.", 
                "It's got its share of flaws, but overall Treyarch has assembled a great, fast, and fun first-person shooter that, even if you were thinking about finally skipping a year, is still worth your time.", 
                "I prioritise the giddy highs of the Black Ops II's exhilarating multiplayer over the disappointment of its poor and brief campaign. Be very careful if you don't.", 
                "Despite all of these changes in Call of Duty: Black Ops II, the single- and multiplayer aspects can't quite shake the feeling of déjà vu. On the other hand, it's the same experience that many players have known since Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare.", 
                "Right now military shooters share the problem of the WWII action games from about five years ago: Eventually you have seen everything and played everything, over and over, again and again.

Tried the campaign, and while Treyarch's character models are looking a little better, they're still outdated compared to most other AAA titles on the market. (Halo, BF3) the terrain in the game still looks like original Xbox. The grass doesn't move when touched causing really awkward moments when grass is coming out of your gun or through someone. The gameplay? It's.......CoD. The absolute LEAST tactical war game on the market. You can literally stand in one place and alternate triggers to kill everyone in the area via the aim snap. If you want some really intense gunplay (and a better story) check out Halo 4 or BF3. The multiplayer? Treyarch/Activision know that new guns/perks/maps =/= new features right? New features are things like the magnets in Halo 4's forge world, or (as far as Halo is concerned) having sprint be permanent. In BF3 (for Xbox) it's the advanced server browser. CoD does not add features. The last feature added was theater mode. The maps I played were boring. It seems that in the world of CoD, firefights only happen on two floors: there;s the ground or the one floor up from the ground, sometimes cleverly disguised as a hill. All of the games sounds still sound like toy guns. They have no oomph at all. The create a class perks and weapons hold nothing new. The emblem creator remains one of Treyarch's best features, and that's not even new. Every year that CoD comes out, I want to enjoy it, I want to see what those millions of players see, and every time I am heartily disappointed. People apparently just want to sprint across the battlefield and pull the trigger. No tactic, no plan, just twitch reflex. Do not mistake that for skill. Twitch/trigger and skill are very different. When characters die in 3 shots and all the maps are tiny, it's not hard to spray and pray. Deal with as many enemies on a much bigger map or when they have shields......then we'll see what's up.

It makes the rest of us gamers look like stupid, boneheaded idiots incapable of basic critical techniques.\r That said, Black Ops 2 is a step up in just about every way possible from the first Black Ops, and a refreshing change of pace from MW3, which felt too similar to MW2 in too many ways. The campaign is as bombastic as ever (with branching paths and unique endings), the multiplayer has been tweaked just enough to keep things interesting, and the zombies are back as Treyarch's well-known signature on the franchise. There are a few things that don't work quite as well as they could have (the Strike Force missions are wonky in the A.I. department), and the execution of some of the plot elements are ham-fisted at times, as with just about any other CoD title. If you liked Black Ops or you're into fast-paced shooters, Blops 2 is a no-brainer.\r As for the keyboard warriors out there frothing at the mouth over \"another year, another Call of Duty game,\" hate all you want.

While I disagree that this holds back independent studios from making original titles, I can see how someone couldAlright, first of all there is no reason anyone would five this game less than a 7.0 unless they are trying to make a point about the degradation of game industry due to mega franchises like Call of Duty, Madden, or Assassins Creed putting out huge budget games every year.  While I disagree that this holds back independent studios from making original titles, I can see how someone could believe this, and not all of the negative reviews are simply trolls, even though this will be prevalent for all Call of Duty games from now on, but this is just a fact of life and should not affect your view of the game.    Now on to the game itself. Lets us start with the campaign. The length is comparable to that of the original Black Ops, expect to put between 7-10 hours into it, depending on the difficulty of which you play. Treyarch brought in the co-writer of the Dark Knight Rises to write the script, as many of you already know, and overall this is my favorite story in a Call of Duty game to date.  While the story has the insane set pieces we all expect, I was surprised by the impact of the quieter moments, in particular Frank Woods helping us transition from the missions set in the 1980s to the futuristic warfare of 2025, all from his wheelchair in an old folks home.  The villain is set up with a backstory that causes him to go all **** the world\" crazy, and while this transition is little far fetched, ok maybe more than a little, it is nice to have a villain that we can sympathize with as a real human being, not just evil for the sake of evil *cough* Makorav *cough* One major hiccup is the strike force missions, which fell like a 99 cent RTS you would play on your iPhone. The squadrons you control clearly never saw Tropic Thunder, because they sure as hell go full retard in these tiresome missions. Choices that actually effect the way the story plays out add replay value, and a much needed kick to the on rails action of the previous titles.\r + Exhilarating set pieces complimented by smaller, more intimant moments.\r+ Good villain.\r+ Cool futuristic gadgets.\r+ Best story to date for the franchise.\r+ Multiple endings.\r- A little shorter than I was hoping.\r- Strike force missions\r- Some hard to believe jumps in the narrative.\r Campaign - 8.5 Multiplayer is pretty much what you would expect with some welcome additions, if you enjoyed previous games multiplayer offering, you will like Black Ops IIs even better. There seems to be great gun balancing gives players a balanced playing field from the get-go , and colorful maps that are a nice change from the dirty snow and brown of the original Black Ops.  Customizability is the core of Black Ops II multiplayer, and it works fantastically.  You now have 10 points to spend on pretty much anything. Want to forgo a secondary weapon for a fourth perk? Want three attachments on your weapon and skip over grenades? All this is possible and more in the most robust and customizable multiplayer offering to date, not just of Call of Duty games, but of any FPS released on console in the last few years.\r +Great gun and explosion sound effects.\r+Robust customizability. +Weapon balancing. + - High paced, twitch shooter mechanics.\r-If you don't like Call of Duty multiplayer, Black Ops II probably wont convert you.\r-Engine looks slightly outdated, but still runs silky smooth at 60 fps.\r Multiplayer - 9.0\r I know a lot of people are excited most for zombies. I have never really been a fan of it ever since the Nazis became undead in World at War, so I might not be the best to review this section of the game.  One of my previous gripes was how long it took to get to rounds that were actually challenging and after playing a map 3 or 4 times I didn't want to grind through those early levels again.  Black Ops II adds customization (I need a thesaurus, i know) to Zombies by allowing you to set options like headshots only, and what round you start on. This combined with Tranzit mode. It is not really a campaign as many expected, but it adds tons of vague hints of backstorys and hidden items to find that really propel this mode past the tiresome survival mode we are all used to, and many will still enjoy.\r +Options to tailor the Zombie experience to your liking.\r+Tranzit mode adds depth we have not seen before.\r-Survival still gets boring after a few playthroughs, for me.\r-No true campaign or narrative.\r Zombies - 7.5    Overall an amazing experience for any video gamer who has ever enjoyed any of the previous Call of Dutys, and a great place to start if you are looking to jump into the franchise.  More content than any game this side of Halo 4 with an exhilarating campaign and a customizable multiplayer and zombie experience. While this game is far from perfect, and will most likely not sway anyone that is not a fan of the series, Black Ops II offers enough great content to keep someone (me) playing for months on end.\r Overall - 8.75… Expand",

After having played about 3 hours of Black Ops II, I am certain that I would take this over Halo if I had to choose.  I don't want to take anything away from what 343 did this year, because they truly did an incredible job under a huge microscope.  Here though, is where I feel Black Ops wins out.\r First, it has now become pretty exciting experimenting with the 10 slot load out....it's actually fun to experiment and take those classes into bot games even, just to see how they feel.  You can get numerous different results with just one weapon....and the best part is that it is not complicated.  Halo impressed me with its simplicity of load outs....CoD impressed me even more by giving us the option to dig deeper without adding confusion....you can tell they worked very hard on this.\r Second, I find still that with Halo, everyone is going for the head, and it becomes a race to see who can break down the shield first.  Some attributes do change this formula, but for the most part, people are running around with their Battle Rifle (or whatever basic primary weapon you prefer), and it becomes a race to hit the head and get trigger happy.  CoD makes weapon exploration exciting and challenging, and your success will solely depend on how well you use the load out you created.\r Finally, I am surprised nobody yet has talked about the incredible improvements to audio yet...the grenades just POUND in the earphones...if it's close by when it goes off, it will catch you by surprise.  Halo also improved on their audio, but CoD REALLY needed change in their sound design.  I think the mixing and recreation of the sound effects was simply superb.\r I am glad to own both games, and when I say I would pick CoD over Halo, it means I pick with a slight edge.

I for one really hope that both games can shake a bit of a monkey off their back, and that the majority of naysayers for either game will go hide in their cave if they can't see the effort put into both of these titles this year.

Every year they sell over 20 million copies and break new records. Every year they receive their fair share of haters and naysayers, but the next year those same people will buy it again. While COD has only recently innovated in Advanced Warfare (7 years after the most revolutionary title in the series, Modern Warfare), each entry is fun and worth a play- even if we get a dud here and there like with last year's Ghosts. In my opinion though, no title has been anywhere near as good as the game I am currently reviewing- Black Ops II. It is easily the best game in the entire series and is one of my favourite games. Why? Well there are three reasons- the multilayered campaign, the addictive multiplayer and the ever amazing Zombies mode...\r Let's start with the multiplayer. The standard levelling and progression systems remain, but it isn't like they need an overhaul. However, this time better bonuses and unlockables can be acquired  and the amount of content is still staggering. However, it is never overwhelming due to a user friendly interface and layout. New modes are also featured, with Hardpoint being a fairly good option for a few games. The new maps are just as memorable as that of the first as well. A map set at a rocket base, a map  within a Hollywood mansion, a map within a cruise ship... Nuketown returns as a free DLC with its own 2025 makeover as well! The design of the maps is inspired and while you will spend most of your time running around and shooting people, Easter Eggs are hidden within each location as well. You can play a game of basketball on Raid or find Batman on Hijacked... The work within these maps is staggering. Of course, there is still plenty of innovation at work with a new Scorestreak system that encourages you to help your team and complete objectives so that you can earn UAVs, Care Packages or even Chopper Gunners. I like this new system and Create A Class has managed to advance a lot by taking things away- particularly the amount of stuff you can take. You can pick 10 slots, whether it be perks, weapons or attachments and while this option can be changed offline, it encourages you to think when playing online. Speaking of offline, it is still worth playing locally for a few hours if you're in the mood for some brainless fun with friends. Multiplayer is the go to mode for this game, just like it is with every COD, but the campaign is finally amazing...\r The real innovation in the story for this game is that it lets you pick how the narrative plays out. There are only three major choices to take, with the smaller ones only changing a few cutscenes or lines of dialogue. However, these three choices lead to separate endings that will dramatically affect the outcome of the characters. I love this style of decisions that aren't apparent and that will subtly change the game originally, before completely ripping it apart. As for the story, well, it's excellent! Starting off in the 1980s, it charts a personal story throughout the Mason family. Raul Menendez is one of the most sympathetic villains in COD history and is easily the best. He has a large story arc and you spend a whole level as him just to see what it's like in his shoes. He was a key villain throughout the early Cold War and now he wishes to begin a new one decades later in the near future setting of 2025. Of course Alex has a son and his youngster, David, is there to stop his father's old foe. Familiar faces return like Woods and Reznov and they provide exposition to the story, but also enhance it in a great manner. Surprisingly, there is an emotional depth and an amount of gravitas in this story that has never been seen in COD and that is what makes this campaign stick out.\r Of course, enough innovation has been provided so that this campaign is the most varied and advanced in the history of the franchise. You now have the option to pick your loadouts before missions and collectibles actually have an impact on the narrative. There are also real-time strategy missions that see you directing squads and jumping between soldiers, trying to attack or defend or a point. They also change the outcome of your campaign and remain for a limited time so you really have to jump into them straight away. Along with this, the set pieces are bigger and better than ever. An opening boat chase, a drone run through the streets and an infiltration mission on a futuristic resort... COD is still the Micheal Bay of games.\r Along with this, the beloved Zombies mode returns with a new open world \"Tranzit\" design that fleshes out the narrative, provides a new boss and puts you in the roles of likeable new characters. There are also smaller maps and more modes and the new guns and perks are appreciated. I've always liked Zombies and while the DLC maps are way better, the base ones are still worth a play.\r BLOPSII is awesome and is my favourite Call of Duty. The campaign, the online, the Zombies...play it!… Expand",

The game offers a forgettable campaign that is more interactive movie than shooter. The story is convoluted and sloppy. It's essentially an on rails shooter with equal parts gameplay and cinematics. For us older gamers who appreciated the heydays of ID and Valve, this is a dreadful combination. Is the expeexpectation that shooters involve tons of shooting asking too much? Treyarch added RTS elements called Strikeforce missions to the series. Unfortunately, they’re half-baked additions that detract from the experience. Completing the missions affects the ending, but the ending is chaotic either way. If you want an engaging campaign, look elsewhere. Who am I kidding? COD games are known for their multiplayer experiences. The zombie mode is disappointing. The maps are cramped and dull. The zombies are dull. The gameplay is dull. It’s just plain dull. If you want zombies, pick up Left for Dead 2. The Left for Dead series sets the gold standard for zombie games and has an active online community. After all the hype surrounding the zombie mode, I’m left scratching my head asking myself: Why is this so popular? Perhaps I’m missing something. BO 2’s zombie mode demonstrates why Valve games have such long self-lives.The regular multiplayer is appreciably better. The game performs admirably on Xbox with smooth and swift action. That is the hallmark of COD games: performance. That being said, there is little innovation. The graphics are noticeably dated and almost cartoonish. The “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality of Activision is hard to justify after playing this game. It’s just another twitch finger multiplayer. The customization system is OK, but most upgrades feel useless. Also, footsteps are inaudible. Being stabbed in the back feels cheap because you literally never hear it coming. The multiplayer maps are tiny which negatively impacts gameplay. The result is an overabundance of SMG users. These guns possess absurd short to mid-range stopping power. Hip firing SMG's easily clears out rooms full of baddies. There is also an overabundance of quick scoping. Players running around with sniper rifles getting quick, close-range kills is just ridiculous. The scorestreak system is flawed as it only rewards the top 10-20% of players with the best bonuses. Since scorestreaks can be carried thru multiple rounds they are spammed during tiebreakers. The argument that the COD multiplayer is an unrealistic arcade shooter certainly applies here. You can snipe with SMG’s and get kills on the run with sniper rifles. All that said, once you master the game, it can be fun. Thankfully, combat training allows players to hone their skills without affecting their much revered stats. You can still rank up and unlock attachments for your weapons, but the round bonuses are reduced by half. The online community for COD is massive. Lobbies are always full for all game modes. If you have a fast internet connection, change your settings to only connect with players with an equally fast or faster connection. This can significantly reduce lag and bullet warping. However, the COD community is a bittersweet asset. It’s brimming with sore losers who love nothing more than to pester players for violating the “rules”. Camping and “noob toobing” are apparently grave offenses and merit harassment and name calling against those engaging in such reprehensible behaviors. Using an LMG with a target finder is also deplorable and deserves racist and homophobic taunts. The amount of harassment and name calling I’ve experienced in Black Ops 2 is unrivalled on any Xbox game I’ve play. It's nasty at times. What’s saddening is that children are just as nasty as adults. I blame parents for this. Still, Xbox and Activision do poor jobs enforcing the Code of Conduct that everyone agrees to. The general consensus in a BO 2 lobby: Reporting someone brings zero results. The notion that Xbox’s reporting system is broken fosters this behavior. Considering Xbox Live Gold is a paid service, they should do a better job censuring players. Black Ops 2 does a lot of things, but it doesn’t do anything well. The campaign is awful. The multiplayer unbalanced. And the zombie mode is just plain overhyped. Ghost Recon Future Soldier didn't receive the hype and is a excels as shooter. But Future Soldier is tough because it involves heavy tactics and teamwork which turns most players off. COD games are popular because the games are technically easy to play. This is unfortunate because there are much better games out there which are left cowering in the shadow of a subpar, overhyped behemoth.… Expand",

I was skeptical at first, but when I actually played it, I realized my original thoughts on the game all turned out to be opposite. The gameplay is the same as always, but some aspects of the campaign add to the mix. The campaign is actually the best part about the game. The story is well-written, and I say it's story is up there with CoD4. I like how you can now customize a class before starting a campaign mission. the access kit perk you can get is pretty nice, as it adds the sense of nonlinear gameplay, which is something I really like. The strike force missions, however, are one of the game's worst aspects.  I didn't like the fact that RTS missions were in a game like Call of Duty, but the way the Strike force missions are set up is downright confusing. Unless you're going for the best ending of the game, ignore all of these missions. Black Ops II is the first to feature multiple endings. While I wasn't anticipating this to work, especially for Call of Duty, Treyarch manages to make it work just fine. The multiplayer is just like previous titles, with a level 55 cap before reaching prestige. the new game modes add to the fun, but I usually don't play multiplayer that often. That's because of the worst aspect of the game: the Pick 10 System. The Pick 10 system is terrible; I don't understand why the classes are now limited. Sure, there are more customization options, like the wildcards, but their effect doesn't matter when you reach the limit. It should have been like previous titles, and just have one or two wildcards. the custom classes were doing just fine in Black Ops, MW3, and even this game's singleplayer, so what happened here? The zombies mode, while good, isn't as good as previous zombie modes. the transit mode didn't entertain me that much, grief mode is a mess, and survival isn't as fun anymore since new gameplay options are being added. You may call adding new modes to zombies is a positive, but I usually don't like it when more things are added to something simple, like zombies. that may just be because I had a lot more enjoyment with past games than this one. Overall, Black Ops II isn't a bad game, just a decent, kind of bland one. The campaign will have you playing it again thanks to nonlinear gameplay, the multiplayer is butchered thanks to the Pick 10 System, and the zombies, while still enjoyable, doesn't seem as fun as past zombie modes.

Treyarch introduces choices for the campaign--- some of which affect which of the three endings you get. Additionally, new optional missions called Strike Force are included. These are fun on the lower difficulties, since you feel as if you are in control of the whole battlefield, which is great  but on the harder difficulties, it proves impossible since the AI on your side simply cannot hold its own against the larger and stronger enemy forces. As a final last touch, you can now pick your weapons and perks before going into battle. The plot unfortunately isn't too great: they make Menendez (the antagonist) too much of the villain who is always one step ahead and flawless, up until the very end where that image magically dies in the finale. The rest is still worth playing for, however.\r The multiplayer, is as expected. Not a lot has changed since Cod 4: although killstreaks are now pointstreaks which thankfully award actually going after the objective instead of camping. The new \"pick ten\" class design is nice, adding flavor to the otherwise bland class design we've all seen before. The camos and emblem designer are hardly worth mentioning. Treyarch at least brings back classic maps like NukeTown and a redesign of Firing Range, which is at least neat. The maps are good too, and the weapons all feel balanced--- no MW2 noob tubes here.\r Zombies is where BO2 really shines: The new maps are tons of fun to explore, discover secrets on, and of course kill zombies. DLC gets lots of criticism, but the maps are usually worth it: the maps are very well done and Zombies' fun gameplay does a lot to breathe life into this otherwise overdone series.\r All in all, I would rate campaign at a 8, multi at a 7, and the zombies at a 9. Each is worth playing, however, I would go for the campaign and zombies. Those two both have the most variety and new stuff, and it makes this game worth buying.

Working on what it's done best, Treyarch takes the brightest idea from past installments and reworks them, with a outstanding and truly worth playing campaign. The multiplayer, despite receiving a fresh coat of paint on the interface, that  still doesn't hide the fact it's still missing some key components to make it run. As for Zombies, it was more or less a let down, not bad I'll say, just not up to what they had advertised.\r Campaign: First off the interface. Unlike older titles, Treyarch decided to introduce it's multiplayer selection system to allow for players to choose what they want to play with, what attachments, and even equipment. Even though this did make playing through on Veteran a tad bit easy since you could just choose to overpower your setup with the best possible weapons, it didn't take away or hurt the experience.\r The story had a very large amount of thought put into it, making for the best and most contemplating experience to date. It raises questions of plausibility, something other titles lacked with their over the top plot lines and dumb decisions. Looking at you MW3. Really?! You expect me to believe modern Russia is gonna take on EVERYONE?! That's just stupid.\r Spanning two different time frames, the story is either told by the aged Frank Woods, or through the eyes of David Mason, Alex Mason's son. Alex being the protagonist from Black Ops. Set in the year 2025, this brought up doubts on how well Treyarch would be able to portray the future, but surprisingly, they created a justified and believable world.\r Treyarch's promise of player choice was well portrayed, and even though this isn't choice like a sandbox game, every major thing you do has a reaction, changing the scope of the ending all together. Some of the choices though don't display which is the correct answer till a second play through. Also, some choices are extremely telegraphed, making it very easy to tell what you should or shouldn't do. Player choice is kinda a hit or miss type of setup. It's nice, and here's hoping Treyarch continue the trend, but it isn't perfect in this installment.\r Gameplay is the same as always though, cheap gimmicks to draw in players combined with a stealth mission, a helicopter mission, ect. ect. It follows that Call of Duty formula we're all so used to. But atleast in this title we are informed why we're doing each mission. Unlike that of Ghosts, in which the developers simply assumed we want to go along with it, instead of persuading us.\r All in all, the campaign, though slightly short for a single play-through, is definitely the best piece of the package. Requiring multiple plays to get the whole story.\r Multiplayer: Simply put, it's the same horse, but with a different saddle. The maps are all still fitting into that medium to small size that doesn't really allow for much diversity or tactics. The weapons list is still flooded with SMG's and Assualt Rifles. And a lack of genuinely new or exciting game modes is really a let down.\r The interface though had donned a new set up for the Create-A-Class, titled Pick 10. This allows players to mix and match to suit their play style, which definitely helped the game feel not quite so redundant.\r Create-a-Emblem had been greatly enhanced though, adding 22 more layers than it's predecessor, Black Ops. Still though, it's not as great or detailed as say the Forza Layer creator system is. It's not a bad change, but it could still use some work.\r Overall, the multiplayer is still virtually the same, but it is a bit of an improvement from MW3's lack of innovation.\r Zombies: Though not quite a campaign like everyone was hoping for, myself included, it adds quite a few nice touches and a much larger map than any before. Most of the gameplay gimmicks seem like just that at first glance, but the more a player digs, the more they unearth. Though no real story is present in Tranzit, a small story can be achieved with two to four player co-op, in 'The Tower of Babble' Achievement/Trophy. The fact this has to be in co-op though is a little unfair, since players like myself try to stay away from coordinating other players. Some prefer to work alone.\r All in all, it's a fun addition with much enjoyment to be had.\r Call of Duty: Black Ops II is a fun game for the series and a much needed improvement, but it's still Call of Duty at it's core. It's plagued by issues that developers seem to wanna ignore, such as multiplayer map size, or linear gameplay.

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nThis review is based on the multiplayer aspects of this game. The servers are horrendous. You will be migrating hosts much more frequently than any other COD game. The lag compensation is a joke. When two opposing players are fighting for a kill, you swear that you shot first and hit him 3 to 5 times. When you see the killcam, you only get one or two hits and the other guy gets off two or three shots on you and kills you instead. The maps are either too big, or way too small. Nuketown 2025 is a waste of development. It's the exact same layout as BO1. The spawning is ridiculous. Enemies spawn behind you so many times, or they spawn you in an enemies sights.\r The variety of weapons are pathetic. The gun stats in BO2 are awful. I'm an assault rifle guy, and I could barely tell any difference at all using the fully automatic assault rifles other than firing rate and accuracy. What kills me is that the last assault rifle you unlock has only average gun stats. When I work my tail off to level up, I should be rewarded with a gun that kicks butt, not a gun that has middle to below average stats. Pistols and SMGs are overpowered. Light machine guns are terrible, and take an eternity to reload. Shotguns have ridiculous range for some reason. Sniper rifles should be banned from any future COD games. Grenades/Semtex work well, but Crossbows are still as annoying as ever. I don't like the fact that you can't remove arrows or Semtex you get stuck with if you realize it just in time. You're able to throw back grenades other people send at you, so why aren't you able to do this? When it tells you \"Stuck\", it might as well say \"Bye Bye\". Finally, the tomahawk and knife melee. If you include weapons that cause instant death in a video game, the death better make sense! The tomahawk shouldn't be an instant kill if it just hits you, especially if it's been thrown from over 50 feet away. I'm not a game designer, but even I know how obnoxious that is. If it hits you in the head, I can understand. The knife melee, a simple knife swipe to a player shouldn't mean instant death. Maybe give him a few seconds after getting swiped to stay alive before dying. Also, when I do the knife melee on someone directly in front of me, it almost always misses. On killcams, the knife melee sometimes looks like it's missing the target, but hits anyway, which is complete BS.\r On to the Scorestreaks. Some of them are upgraded versions of what we already know. But, they got rid of the best part of BO1. I'm talking about if you didn't use your Killstreak reward before restarting a new Killstreak, it stacked up. I loved when I had 3 RC-XDs and used them all within a couple minutes. In this game, if you don't use your Scorestreak rewards and start a new one, you lose the rewards you previously had. Some Scorestreaks are extremely cheap, When a Lightning Strike Scorestreak is activated, you get no time at all to get to cover because the command lets you know almost right after the bombs drop. When a Napalm Strike killstreak is activated in BO1, you get a command and around 3 seconds to get to cover before it hits. In BO2, you're pretty much screwed when Lightning Strike is activated. Also, when Lightning Strike or Hellstorm Missiles are activated, sometimes even if you are indoors, it still kills you. Treyarch, you didn't program destructive environments in this game, so this shouldn't happen. The UAV has been severely nerfed, it's only up for barely 10 seconds, and is almost always destroyed by the opposition within about 5 seconds. The absolute worst Scorestreak is the attack dogs. Why is it when a dog jumps you it's instant death? Give the player a fighting chance when it jumps you to shake it off or knife melee it, but don't make it instant death. There are better options for Scorestreaks other than dogs. You know how in the loading screens, it says, \"A well timed knife strike will kill an incoming attack dog\"? With the knife melee almost useless now, it's nearly impossible.\r The Perks, along with the Custom Class system have been changed for the worse. They have introduced Wild Cards which you can use to double up on Perks 1, 2, and 3, add another attachment to your primary weapon, etc. This would have been great, but there's just one problem, you can only have 10 items in a class, and the Wild Cards count towards your 10 items. What kind of sense does that make? The Wild Card isn't an actual item you carry! Also, you can only carry one type of lethal/tactical equipment, which is a downgrade from all the other games before this. You were able to carry grenades and claymores/bouncing betties before, why change now? The only good thing they did is that the Ghost Perk can make you invisible from UAV only when you're moving now. Stop releasing these games every year, Activision. Spend more than a year of development on it to iron out the problems to make this an experience to remember, and not one to throw out the window.… Expand",

They try to deviate from becoming a linear corridor shooter by supposedly providing player with options but they don't truly affects the game. The ending on the other hand might. Which is suppose to add re playability to the first person campaign, but there's really no reason to play over the same campaign for just a different ending. Multiplayer, this is the are where this game should shine but it seems the MP portion of this game feels a lot similar to that of MW3 and of course Black Ops. Small scaled maps with tons of areas to camp. Basically comes down to which ever team can camp the middle ground the best wins the game. The rest is just protecting the same corner through out the game with occasionally moving 3-6 feet away from your old camp spot to corner camp in a different spot.  There are no need to watch your back as certain equipment and streaks do that for your. The game is slow paced and also suffers from the same old bad hit detection. While it does some what fix old issues like knifing people from miles away, it does at times glitch and can cause your character to launch at another player. Kill streaks seem re-hashed but with an added \"futuristic\" approach.  There's always lag and horrible host selection, the spawn points are mediocre at best, but what can one expect from such small maps that are crammed with buildings to make them seem \"big.\" The leveling system online has been set to keep players from playing. While it gives players who have been playing the game longest the upper hand with over powered weaponry and the best perks. The new set up is suppose to force players into playing the objective, that is not the case. The way the maps are set up actually encourage players to whore kill streaks and never actually go for any objective. Word of advice, try to level as fast as you can to get ghost perk, it's a uav whore type of game. Zombies: This is where this game shines. It's somewhat new but refreshing at the same time reminds me a bit of Left for Dead. Which is great fun to be honest.

While the series has stuck rigidly to its scripted, shooting gallery single player since the first game its the multi-player changes of MW1 that really brought the series to the top of its tree. That was 2007, since then we've had 4 more COD games and according to many its the lack of change in the series that has brought the recent negativity around the series which started getting very noticeable with the MW3 release. Well i didn't buy MW3, the last one i had was Black Ops 1, my favourite of them all was World At War and i have to say that overall this is nothing new.\r Firstly the campaign, yes it offers choices which are cool as they affect the ending, good idea. However the narrative, the actual missions themselves, for me its all so boring now. The story flicks between the 80's and 2025 and after few missions you really dont know why your doing anything or where you are. You just shoot hordes or re-spawning grunts until you pass a 'trigger' which progresses the action. Its uninspired and tedious, i was doing all this in COD1and i found it difficult to motivate myself to persist with it and its plethora of clichés and stereotypes.\r The new Strike missions are supposed to introduce a limited 'strategy' element to the single player. You command some squads of troops, some drones etc. and can control from a command view. The big problem is that the AI of your forces is so bad that the only way to succeed is to personally take control of troops and basically do the job yourself, which means you just end up doing what you were doing in the main story missions but with no recognisable characters or reasons to care, and they were lacking enough in the first place.\r Graphics and sound design is the same as before really, maybe a slight improvement but nothing to write home about, its good enough but i cant help but think its about time they introduced a significantly better graphics engine and stopped recycling the same textures and animations throughout every game.\r The multi-player suite returns with zombies bolted on again. Zombies is improved with some new content, game modes and equipment which breathes some new life into it, but it does not retain the appeal it had when it was a completley new feature, it doesn't feel that they innovated enough to me. They have tried to improve it no doubt but its not as exciting as it was, largely due to the fact its nothing new. Its functional and fun though and can still be a good blast with friends.\r As for the multi-player? Well its COD's bread and butter right? Its not evolved much at all.The introduction of the ten point system is good but hardly warrants the buy alone, score streaks over kill-streaks? Not really a big change, you still need to stay alive as with a kill-streak so same principles.\r The action is fast paced as usual, reliant on fast-twitch reactions more than tactics. Still no destructible environments or vehicles. Same game modes bar hard point which is a poor version of headquarters for me. Domination is the most fun but overall its all the same stuff as before, same animations, same graphics, same game. League play is a nice addition for those willing to invest the time and not addicted to unlocks and levelling up.\r Having really enjoyed the open environments and more warfare like BF3 multi-player i cant help but feel restricted and confined by COD (and i'm a fan of both series), they really need to freshen it up, it feels recycled and cheap. It wouldn't be overly harsh to say its BLOPS1 with a map pack, weapons pack, few new game modes and a little bit of polish. If you want more of the same then you wont go wrong, if you were looking for further evolution in the COD series the you'll need a time machine, the year 2007 and MW1 because that's where it remains.\r Disappointing. 5/10… Expand",

                "Graphically Modern Warfare 2 sets a bar so high that the game that our industry will look to it as a blueprint of what can be done on next-gen systems. The developers found a perfect balance between realistic and entertainment (just wait until you play-through the airport level) that there were points during our review period that we actually forgot we weren’t watching a HD movie.", 
                "I was impressed by its presentation, visuals and the wealth of gameplay it offers. I even enjoyed its story—though it’s admittedly fluffy, convoluted and campy in spots, it’s like a interactive war movie on TV that takes liberties with realism for the sake of being entertaining to watch (such as having an amazingly large number of helicopters crash to the ground over the course of the game).", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is sensational, and sets a very high bar in the Call of Duty series. Well done guys!", 
                "It was expected to be one of this year greatest gamers, and yes, it is.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 was super-hyped, but Infinity Ward didn't disappoint: this is undoubtedly the most spectacular FPS around, made with extraordinary care and attention to details. If you're looking for an astonishing single player experience or a deep and enduring multiplayer, this is the game to buy.", 
                "Infinity Ward hits another one out of the park with Modern Warfare 2.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 shatters the old standard of excellence and has raised the bar for what it means to be an epic shooter. With a mind-shattering campaign, superb co-op play, and the deepest multiplayer experience on Live, Modern Warfare 2 is one of the greatest shooters in gaming history, and a must-own for fans of the genre.", 
                "Multiplayer is fast, frantic and as exciting as ever.", 
                "Everything a great sequel should be, and fans of the series will love the additions Infinity Ward have included this time around. Easily one of the best games this year, and a contender for the best shooter currently available for next-gen consoles.", 
                "When it comes to games which offer single and multiplayer, you'd have to be a harsh judge to claim a better first person shooter on console has been released this year, if ever. Modern Warfare 2 is closer to fulfilling the promises made by Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 than any game out there beyond Uncharted 2.", 
                "The air of unpredictability and the care that was paid to each separate element puts it in lofty company. The multiplayer hasn't received an overhaul, but considering most shooters are still playing catch-up with Call of Duty 4, the tweaks and twists make it the best multiplayer shooting experience in the industry. Few games manage to meet such high expectations.", 
                "The War on Terror never rests. The same goes for Infinity Ward, who raises the bar again with Modern Warfare 2. Its new campaign keeps delivering a cinematic, inmersive, and visually spectacular experience, while polishing AI and respawn issues, and offering a minimum of 8 hours of gameplay. Without a multiplayer rival, where it's as powerful as a Tactical Nuke, including a first approach to coop, and archiving excellence in every aspect, this last Call of Duty proves itself as a very solid candidate to become the game of the year.", 
                "The surprise factor of the first Modern Warfare is missing, although it doesn’t affect this awesome sequel which is even better than the former. This new Call of Duty iteration exceeds every expectation and earns a place among the best shooters of this year.", 
                "For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games.", 
                "The story is compelling, the multiplayer is addictive, and Special Ops mode comes out of the gate swinging, prepared to shock gamers with a feature most likely didn’t know existed. The package, on the whole, is spectacular, there’s no two ways about it.", 
                "Perhaps the greatest feat that Infinity Ward has performed is not only living up to the hype of Modern Warfare 2, but actually exceeding it.", 
                "But value and longevity be damned, it’s the emotional impact Modern Warfare 2 brings to the table that in the end deserves the highest of praise.", 
                "The cinematic appeal of the singleplayer action makes it infectious and hugely memorable in a way few if any other games can manage. That this is bundled with the best multiplayer experience of any game really leaves us in little doubt that this is the complete package.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 raises the bar for online gaming making this a must have for this area alone.", 
                "The game constantly adds something new to the mix without straying too far from the traditional first-person shooter formula and is sure to be worth the wait for fans everywhere.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2's emotional and intense single-player game is a thrilling rollercoaster ride of exciting moments, while the multiplayer is truly a definitive experience for online FPS players everywhere. This game lives up to the hype.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a must have game and one that should stay in your collection...period.", 
                "If the campaign's story was shaped better and made more sensible, and if the online Perks were just a tiny bit more balanced, this would be a near-perfect game, no shadow of a doubt. As it stands, however, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is an utterly stellar achievement that knows exactly what its audience wants, and delivers in abundance. Truly, this is the biggest game of 2009.", 
                "There was a lot of hype leading up to the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and for the most part the sequel lives up to it’s billing.", 
                "The campaign, while short, is epic and a lot more intense then the original Modern Warfare.  The enemy A.I. is a lot smarter and will make you rethink your tactics from time to time.", 
                "Deliver[s] an intense and satisfying gaming experience.", 
                "With the music of Hans Zimmer and the cinematic scenes, you're sucked into the game and spit out after you’re done. The single player is rather short. It will take you about six hours to beat the game, but you get an intense and memorable ride the entire time. The game seems to be a little scripted, but it isn’t annoying for everyone. The multiplayer isn’t annoying at all. You can play for hundreds of hours without being bored. The Spec Ops mode extends that with fun for two.  If you ever played a shooter and liked it, buy this game!", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is simply a terrific game and a solid addition to the Call of Duty franchise.", 
                "The addition of the masterful Spec-Ops modes goes a long way to making up for the uneven campaign though, and the competitive multiplayer is as addictive as expected.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is easily one of the year’s best games. Because it’s more iterative than innovative, though, it’s not quite as perfect as we’d expected, but it is a terrifically fun, nerve-wrackingly intense spectacle that you’d be crazy to miss.", 
                "The best Call of Duty yet - and possibly, the best shooter, too. Get enlisted. [Winter 2009, p.62]", 
                "Loud, epic and incredibly polished, MW2 is this year's biggest must-have shooter.", 
                "Absolutely one of the most rounded gaming packages of 2009. The single player campaign – while not long – is well-paced, with plenty of variety in settings and gameplay, and will definitely be a steep challenge on the harder difficulty levels. The multiplayer component is fully featured, with an expansive set of modes and maps, and it’s great to see persistent stats returning. Rounding it out is Spec Ops, which is very much the icing on the cake.", 
                "This game has so many standout moments of such immersive power, there really is no other experience out there to touch Modern Warfare 2’s controlled and entertaining pandemonium. Infinty Ward has skill, panache and big, hanging balls that clang as loud as Big Ben, so much so a the bar has been raised with Modern Warfare 2.", 
                "The previous installment was great, but this installment of Call of Duty puts the previous to respectful shame. Packed with the best visuals you've seen on the 360 and fantastic gameplay, you'll have a resonating experience like no other.", 
                "If the first Modern Warfare wasn’t your cup of tea, then it’s unlikely the numerous additions and small tweaks will do anything for you here.  Yet for anyone else who’s a fan of console first person shooters with plenty of replay value, this is a game that’s definitely worth signing up for.", 
                "While I generally don’t often gravitate towards ultra-realistic military shooters, Modern Warfare 2 is easily one of my top games of the year.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a masterpiece in terms of FPS gameplay and graphics. The different locations and the variety of situation you’ll encounter are often jaw-dropping. But it is also a controversial game for some extreme situations the player might encounter along the road.", 
                "Compelling and intense.", 
                "This is a leader in the genre and a must own for anyone who enjoys online combat, and although a longer solo campaign would always be welcome, you can’t accuse what does exist of being underwhelming.", 
                "Doesn't change the record but pumps up the volume. The last essential FPS of the decade. [Jan 2010, p.64]", 
                "MW2 is spectacular in all the right areas; building and refining on the most solid of bases. And although its political heart might not be in the ‘right’ place, at the very least it might make a few people think rather than skim through on muscle memory and twitch reactions. That’s a rarity in itself, and something to be respected in an age of apathy.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles.", 
                "While at times the action can make you whiz by the environments, slowing down will allow you to take in the beauty of the environments. There isn’t quite the real-life detail as seen in the last game with Chernobyl, but Modern Warfare 2 has its own great detailing. And best of all, you won’t have any hiccups or lag.", 
                "Given the care and attention lavished upon the competitive and cooperative multiplayer in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, it's clear that Infinity Ward sees the future of the Modern Warfare series in that particular component. What that means is you'll end up with a game that doesn't show much in the single-player experience, but once you take it online, it's going to be difficult to put down.", 
                "It looks better, it plays better, the story is more intense and the multiplayer is more inviting. And with the inclusion of SpecOps, the longevity of this game is sure to have increased as well.", 
                "At first, it may seem as MW2 is not able to surpass or even match its predecessor, but thanks to a mindblowing second half of the singleplayer-part and a solid multiplayer, it’s nevertheless an amazing experience and a definite \"must-have\" for every shooter fan.", 
                "Multiplayer is what it's all about, and here it's is head and shoulders (and torso and waist and legs and feet) above its nearest competition in terms of accessibility, balancing, strategic depth, technical prowess, and all around fun - so much so that it makes the campaign mode look like an tiny, ugly mole hidden away in some bodily crevice.", 
                "It's well worth picking up, and even if you missed out on the original, there's no reason you couldn't pick this one up and enjoy it just as much as the rest of the fans, making it one of the more accessible \"hardcore\" FPS experiences out there.", 
                "Modern Warfare has no need to fear the comparison with a Hollywood blockbuster. You wouldn't find a game that keeps so in touch and never let’s you go. You just have to go on like you were pulled by a rope.", 
                "With another memorable single player mode to look back on, in addition to the excellent Special Ops mode and more multiplayer goodness to look forward to, Infinity Ward has once again come up with a cinematic masterpiece.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 balances the spectacle and silliness of its single-player campaign with a deep, enduring multiplayer core, carefully covering its bases for players of all persuasions. But there is no denying it seeks merely to build upon the successes of its forebear while doing very little to expand its scope or redefine them.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has more than enough guns, modes and \"oh-my-god\" moments to propel it to the very top of your must have list, with astounding visuals, crystal-clear (and at times, frightening) audio and enough plot twists to make you second guess everything, so gear up, hop onto your snowmobile and haul ass to the nearest store.", 
                "Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is must buy game. Infinity Ward, despite innovating the game, had listened to the players, taking the best features of the prequel and adding something new.", 
                "A dazzling package. A singleplayer campaign crammed with set-pieces that pull the player through at breakneck speed sits alongside Spec Ops, 23 co-op missions and a MW greatest hits package, before that superlative multiplayer, which really needs no introduction. With such attractions on offer, this is a shooter that demands playing, and playing again. It is still Call Of Duty, but its execution is skilful, mostly thoughtful, and it boasts the highest of production values.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is the perfect example of a great sequel for a great game. This awesome first person shooter has a short but exciting story and one of the best multiplayer in the console market. The new mode, called Special Ops., is perfect to co-op with a friend for short and fantastic game sessions.", 
                "It's not the originality of the design, but the workmanship, that makes this one of the best FPS ever.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 ticks all of the right boxes: varied gameplay, immersive story, engaging gunplay, superb multiplayer, and the list goes on... If we're being really nitpicky, then we might suggest that there aren't many innovative features in the game. However, MW2's Spec Ops mode is fresh enough to ensure that the overall package isn't a stale one, while the long-term appeal of adversarial multiplayer will stretch out until the next Infinity Ward release with ease.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 nails the three pillars of play--campaign, cooperative, and multiplayer--to earn its place in the pantheon of modern shooters.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 does indeed live up to the hype. If you've ever wanted to be in an action movie, this is probably the closest you will get.", 
                "The moments when Modern Warfare 2 isn’t good are few and far between. That’s about all you can ask from a hero.", 
                "Though MW2 suffers from some of the same faults as its other ‘modern’ predecessor, its still a well made package that shows how although no game is perfect, a developer can still put out great work. If you like shooters at all, Modern Warfare 2 is the piece of work this year that you should be playing – like, right now.", 
                "Fans of the Call of Duty franchise won’t want to skip Modern Warfare 2 as it’s the most in-depth, involving Call of Duty release to date. Modern Warfare 2 is really three different gaming experiences rolled up into one package, and when you add up the value of each component, Modern Warfare 2 feels like a steal.", 
                "The single player, albeit disappointing, is still an excellent thrill ride and precursor to the main pull: the multiplayer. CoD4 cemented its place as one of the best online shooters going and Modern Warfare 2 builds on it, adding a plethora of new features that constantly reward and amaze.", 
                "They improve the ultimate multiplayer game by adding a lot of options to tune your online experience. The campaign is short and intensive and the Spec Ops mode is a lot of fun for you and a friend.", 
                "As you would expect from a Call of Duty title, Modern Warfare 2 offers an intense and exhilarating single player experience with the only disappointment that it doesn’t last very long.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is an intense ride from start to finish with varied environments and fast paced action in true Infinity Ward fashion. Though the single-player campaign may be only a few hours long the improved multiplayer and Special-Ops co-op missions will keep you busy for months.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is 'just' a videogame, and a damn good one at that, in terms of sheer, heart-thumping spectacle it'll deliver in spades; just don't expect the Second Coming. [Christmas 2009, p.98]", 
                "A must-have game for more than than the multiplayer. [Issue#53, p.82]", 
                "Infinity Ward has made the wise choice of not padding the game out to satisfy angry internet comment posters but has instead provided a completely satisfying experience that sits beside the vast multiplayer components perfectly.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a great game, but not as great as we expected. The revamped multiplayer and new spec ops are worth the price, but the single player is too much similar to the first episode and it lacks the excellence of the story telling of Modern Warfare.", 
                "Did you think you had seen it all in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare? Get ready then for this war! Don't think Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will be a revolution, it's more like an evolution if you compare this to the first Modern Warfare game.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is solid continuation of the original Modern Warfare.", 
                "Modern Warfare 2 is undoubtedly the single biggest release this year; not only in gaming but in entertainment, period. It delivers in a lot of areas; it has a campaign marinated in grandeur (even if it is to short) and a deep, engaging multiplayer facet (even if it is littered with connectivity issues).", 
                "A true video-game equivalent of a Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay action movie. The singleplayer is engaging while it lasts, but the game's true value lies in the multiplayer. The online matches are fast, fun and highly addictive.  [Nov 2010]", 
                "Though not quite living up to its predecessor, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games of the holiday season. With an epic single-player, challenging and entertaining Spec Ops mode and greatly improved multiplayer, Modern Warfare 2 is a call that should not go unanswered.", 
                "If you imagine a game where you have the starring role in a \"realistic\" Roger Moore/Timothy Dalton-era James Bond flick, with more emphasis on shooting things that move and less on scoring with sultry women, then you have a pretty solid idea of what Modern Warfare 2 is all about.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare was a powerful entry into the first-person genre and an example of how linear gameplay could be exciting.", 
                "In spite of its good looks, Modern Warfare 2 has the slightest whiff of insecurity. It feels like the developers, under pressure to top the original Modern Warfare, engaged in a bit of hand-wringing this time around.", 
                "Overall, I found Modern Warfare 2 to be fun but it's starting to lose the appeal it had for me after the fourth time around with Infinity Ward. The campaign is really short and the story's pretty weak. Also, there will be parts that offend people but at least you can skip the \"one\" mission. Multiplayer can be fun and addicting if you don't get frustrated easily.", 
                "There are two issues that make the campaign less than perfect. First is the length. Given the price gouging Activision has embarked on with this release the centrepiece of the game is insultingly short. Played on normal you have one evening's play here for your 50 or so pounds...Secondly the pace of the game is very one note.", 
                "The holiday season is noticeably bare, and Modern Warfare 2 stands tall, with its brilliant, value-packed missions, maps, and promised endless nights of thousand-yard stares and slack-jawed home entertainment"

Even though the campaign was short, there is still a lot more this game has to offer. Spec-Ops is the highlight of the package. Whenever my buddies come over and I don't want my multiplayer stats to be effected, Spec-Ops is always the way to go. The co-operative play is smooth and the variety of mission types is refreshing. The challenge is also very fair, and the sense of accomplishment when beating the harder missions on Veteran difficulty is unforgettable. Sure there are those moments when you are in the last section of a level and your partner just has to kill himself, but once you nail a tough level you truly feel like a gamer.    Now finally comes the immensely frustrating multiplayer package. Most of the reviews you read only focus on the multiplayer and how frustrating it can be. While these reviews may be accurate the score they give the game is not. This is because their review is only for the multiplayer section of the game, and they don't take into account the exciting Spec-Ops and single player campaigns. The multiplayer for this game is extremely addicting. It is incredibly easy to hop into a game and have a blast with some friends, but there is seldom a time when your fun is ruined by players taking advantage of some of the games perks or other add-ons. Grenade launchers, commando knifing, and the spawning system are just a few of the inconveniences you may encounter. Many people stop playing the game due to the deaths they face at the hand of players who rely on tactics that do not require very much skill. If you do not take the game very seriously and just want to run around and have to fun run and gun action, it will be easy to enjoy the multiplayer. To those competitive hard-core gamers there will be much rage quitting ahead.    With all parts of the package taken into account, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 delivers. The high production values are obvious, and the single and co-opertive campaigns are a blast. Sadly the multiplayer content is frustrating to say the least, and not enough effort was put in to ensure a fair and enjoyable experience. Get this game, mostly because everyone else has it, and there is always fun to be found, but sadly a lot of a frustration will come with it.… Expand",

This review is obviously more than a year late and II think that it's a little obvious that the first half of the beginning user critics page is nothing more than a bunch of raging kids who are upset because they cannot win by camping on this game's multiplayer. My only response is that I'm glad that you hate this game, because judging by the way that I guarantee you play, I hate you too. This review is obviously more than a year late and I realized that I just had to write my piece on this phenomenal shooter. Call me a COD nuthugger or whatnot, but when you discard your flaming nerd rage and begin to see clearly, you realize that this really is the top notch pinnacle of military shooters in modern gaming. And yes, it far exceeds Battlefield in almost every aspect. To start, the single player is most definitely and undeniably short, ranging in the neighborhood of about 3 hours or so. But those 3 hours are so remarkably jaw-dropping that it somehow forces you after completion to return to the first level and do it all over again. The voice-acting is tremendously well done, and the graphics, even by today's standards, are simply fantastic. The storyline is extremely believable and the campaign contains some of the most exciting set pieces and action sequences that I have ever witnessed in a shooter. From the very beginning stage, all the way up until the final firefight, I was completely mesmerized at the attention to detail the developers gave this game. The intense gunfights that take place on U.S. soil left me completely wowed, and never once was there a stale moment on the campaign. The Spec Ops co-op mode is a great addition to play through with a friend, providing a host of exciting short missions to blast through. Moving on to what really amazes me is the multiplayer. Every time that I enter another match, it reminds me that this really is the king of all first person shooters. The hit markers are near flawless, aiming is extremely smooth and tight, and the arsenal of weaponry is about as close to completely balanced as you can get. Most of the maps are fantastic, save for a few camper-oriented ones that I veto on sight. The sheer amount of perks, upgrades, weapon attachments, and challenges to unlock is almost overwhelming, and never ceases to be addicting. There is literally always something to keep playing towards to unlock. The newly added unlockable titles from the first game always has me working towards something new, and the emblems as well are a pure blast to unlock. The game keeps track of a huge array of statistics, ranging from obvious headshots of a gun, all the way to the number of times you killed someone with a direct flashbang impact. However, there are still some things that should be tweaked, such as the Danger Close perk and Commando perk, which are both noob-friendly and overpowered. I am a LEGIT level 70 tenth prestige, so I believe I have enough experience to voice my opinion on this. Also, the UMP45 could use a little toning down in terms of damage, accuracy, recoil, or anything else associated with it. The killstreaks are absolutely revolutionary, since you have wannabes such as Medal of Honor and Black Ops that straight up copied the majority of them. The amount of noob campers that are crying about how trashy this game is have absolutely no idea what they're talking about, and are simply there to hate because this game is so popular. And it's popular for good reason too: it's the best military shooter on the market without a doubt. Even though the game infuriates me to no end (at times), I just take a step back and tell myself that despite all of my irrational rage, it's still the best there is, and I know that I'll go back to playing it the next day. And since the game is at a much lower price at the present, you cannot go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy military shooters or shooters in general.… Expand",

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nAs the new Call of Duty is only a few months away; I have decided to do a review on one of the biggest games of 2009. Already the makers of the game have tried to make it into an epic game by having a excellent plot. The story begins at the end of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare with the Ultra-nationalists taking over Russia and making the villian of the first Modern Warfare game (Imran Zakhaev) a hero of Russia. The gamer starts of as Private First Class Allen who helps the Rangers kill some insurgents in Afghanistan were he later finds out that he will join an elite special force who are already on a mission behind enemy lines in Kazahkstan,. The problem I have with this is that he is only a private and that they should of given the role to a more suitable role. Also with the Russians already being in Kazahkstan (I'm guessing through invasion) that the other nations of the world (especially USA) would have declared war. Anyway back to the plot, instead of playing \"Soap\", the gamer now plays as \"Roach\" who is taken under the wing of \"Soap\". The gamer then switches back to play as Private Allen who is sent on an undercover mission to follow Makarov and learn what he is up to. Allen has to do this by helping Makarov slaughter the innocent on Russian land. However, Makarov somehow knew that Allen was not a Russian but an American so he shoots him there and then. This then leads to the Russians blaming the Americans for the deaths of hundreds and decides to go to war against the US. Going back to playing as \"Roach\", the special forces find out that Makarov was behind the attack so the team head to Brazil to find out more info on the whereabouts of Makarov. They do this by interrogating Makarov's weapon dealer who tells them that Makarov's worst enemy is being held captive in a Russian Gulag under the name of Prisoner 627. This then leads to the Americans and the special forces assaulting the Gulag to then find out that Prisoner 627 was in actual fact Captain Price. The special forces then go take on a Russian Naval Base and then Captain Price activates a nuclear warhead in a Russian Sub. During this time, the gamer becomes Private Ramirez who takes part in many spectacular battles in the game; such as the Battle for the White House in Washington D.C. At this point, the US Rangers who you play as are under heavy fire and looks like all is lost until the nuclear warhead that Captain Price fired blows up in space (killing an innocent Astronaut). \"Roach\" and \"Ghost\" then go to gather data on Makarov at his safe house which leads to there sad deaths at the hand of your ally Sheperd. The gamer then plays as Soap and tries to take down Sheperd with the help of Captain Price. The gamer finds out that Sheperd did this due to the amount of soldiers who died in the nuclear explosion in the 1st modern warfare game. At the end of the game, Sheperd is killed and the remainders of the special forces go on the hunt for Makarov. Positives The story was done very well Spec Ops was a different option for the gamers to playI like how it gives the gamer an option to play the Russian Massacre mission Negatives The online needs fixing as the good gamers will easily destroy the average or weaker gamers Rating Overall, I would have to give Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 the rating of 8 out of 10 -- Mr Hannigan… Expand",

While a  co-op campaign would have been better, the Spec-Ops is a nice addition, albeit hard if you're trying to beat them all on veteran. The MP is the MP, you will love it if you enjoyed MW1's MP, or you will hate it. I enjoyed it, but never got to the level cap after two years, while it only took me a couple of months in MW1. If you liked the first, you'll like the second, but it isn't groundbreaking.… Expand",

But the overall 'game' of MW2 is a mixed bag and fails to be something really special, not just a 'fun' or 'popular' game. The single player story is a bad joke, the themes and meanings the story portrays are a contradictory muddled mess. The special Op missions do offer some well designed gameplay but why the story mode is not intertwined is confusing, I would have preferred the entire story dropped for more Special Ops. The multiplayer can be fun for short periods of time but does lack depth which is why it has not resonated as a competitive Esport title.

I started with single player and, as expected, it was over-the-top fast-paced action and that's what made it good. The campaign was short, but it was incredibly exciting despite some of the questionable plot choices. Notable missions include the one with the snowmobiles and the final level. Although they were obvious gimmicks they were extremely enjoyable; so all in all the campaign was quite good in my opinion. The Spec Ops mode offered a nice change from the zombies mode of World at War and was good fun, although I was disappointed to see a lack of support for it - but I'll come to the later. Then we come to the multiplayer mode. At first it was very exciting with awesome new guns and attachments and of course the addition of a multitude of killstreak rewards that you can pick and choose rather than being given the standard 3-5-7 seen in Modern Warfare 1 and World at War. Later on the inevitable and infamous \"Cod rage\" took hold and although this was to be expected with a Call of Duty game, Modern Warfare 2 took it above and beyond. It soon became apparent that the game had been made extremely \"noob-friendly\" with very luck-based gameplay, extremely easy-to-use combinations and clearly overpowered weapons, perks, attachments and killstreak rewards. Furthermore, once the insane power of the killstreak rewards was realised, the game revolved around it and this simply caused camping as players would play Domination (for example) purely so it's a longer match and they can therefore get their nuke with their generic 7-11-25 killstreak set-up. I could go on about multiplayer's flaws but I won't. Support for the game seemed to be a big issue for Infinity Ward. Each new map pack charged us ridiculous prices for a few of new maps and one or two old ones. 1,200 points is far too much for a map pack in my opinion, especially since, in spite of this, Spec Ops saw absolutely nothing new. As well as this, multiplayer was not otherwise changed very often at all to balance the game. The only updates on the game game were when particularly glaring flaws (such as the care package glitches or the Model 1887 issues). Overall, for me the multiplayer simply became more of a stress than fun and it was Infinity Ward's lack of listening to gamers that caused them to do nothing about it, but rather milk the cow with each new overpriced map pack.

                "There's a tangible insistence from gamers that this series needs to evolve, but it seems unwarranted when it still leads the FPS class. The engine's definitely in need of an overhaul, but when it comes to thumping set-pieces and addictive multiplayer design, Modern Warfare 3 is still in a league of its own.", 
                "As a complete package, Modern Warfare 3 takes the cake. [Jan 2012, p.67]", 
                "Quotation forthcoming.", 
                "The solo campaign is fun but bombastic to point of being bewildering, but the rest of the (gargantuan) package is typically life-consuming stuff. [Christmas 2011, p.96]", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 doesn't bring a lot of new stuff to the table, but it has refined single-player and multiplayer experiences to the point where they are as slick as any Hollywood production.", 
                "A perfect example of a great fan service to the community. Activision has heard the players and has created an extremely balanced product that will appeal more to hardcore and casual.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is full of deep, engaging multiplayer and campaign military shooter gaming, so it's easy to recommend.", 
                "Familiar but hardly boring. The control remains top-notch, the audio is excellent, the developers should be commended for squeezing every last drop out of that engine, and the entertainment level remains high throughout. The campaign is too short (no surprise there), the AI is too erratic (and weird things can still happen when playing), and the story is a little uninspired. But when it comes to over-the-top thrills and plenty of \"oh good goddamn\" moments, the campaign brings the heat.", 
                "Despite its flaws, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 takes the fantastic series we've come to love over the years and iterates on it with great success. The multiplayer is hands-down the best it has ever been, with more features, more modes and a ton of new levels and ways to interact via Call of Duty Elite.", 
                "Everything fans may expect. A frantic and incredibly fun multiplayer with tons of options, game modes and unlockables, and also very well polished, and an intense campaign that concludes a story which started with Modern Warfare four years ago. The formula is aging - although it works as well as ever, its visuals are stagnating, but this is still a must-have for those looking for direct action.", 
                "In a single-player campaign that goes a bit over-the-top at times, it's a relief to see that the action is scaled-back with Soap and Price often enough to ensure that these characters receive the billing they deserve. Elsewhere in the multiplayer, Infinity Ward was always going to have a hard time replicating the impact of its package from two years ago but it's managed a rock-solid, if slightly conservative offering for this difficult third album in the Modern Warfare series.", 
                "The big surprise isn't that it serves up another great campaign, but that its take on Modern Warfare's world-conquering multiplayer may be the best yet. With Spec Ops and Survival mode, this is one hell of a package, and sees off the trilogy with a bang: not much has changed, but this is as big and beautiful a game as ever.", 
                "Gameplay-wise, it's essentially the same game; that is, the best online FPS, an exciting and frantic experience. It offers several game modes, new weapons and balances the perks. Also, the competitive and the cooperative experience in Spec Ops and Survival has been greatly improved. And it has the best campaign yet in a Modern Warfare game. Another headshot from Infinity Ward.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 doesn't reinvent the wheel by any means, but there's no denying it's a damn good action-packed blockbuster, and maybe the best Call of Duty to date.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 doesn't do anything new, but it also doesn't do anything wrong. For better or worse, this is a slick and well-metered trio of modes that make an entertaining package, but Sledgehammer Games and Infinity Ward are simply looking to augment previous games rather than expand the series into pastures new.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 meets expectations. The core elements of multiplayer and the campaign remain fundamentally unchanged, but the game serves as a great example of how many subtle tweaks can add up to an improved overall product.", 
                "Feels like a true sequel to the original Modern Warfare in every way, and banishes the memory of MW 2's sorry campaign. The multiplayer is still shockingly playable but it's not a huge leap over what's come before. That said, COD fans are going to love this.", 
                "Largely feels like an iterative title...This isn't to say that Modern Warfare 3 is at all a bad game-it's an attractive and polished effort with tight controls, addictive multiplayer, and the sense that one is truly on a battlefield, rather than carrying on a miniature war behind the scenes.", 
                "The biggest positive about COD has nothing to do with gameplay or graphics. It's the all-inclusive social service Elite. Activision has learned a lot from the likes of Facebook and Twitter. You get loads of ways to connect to and interact with friends who are playing the game. [December 2011, p.54]", 
                "It's all too familiar to MW2, and the multiplayer hasn't really changed either.", 
                "A great first person shooter, but at the same time a formula that starts to feel dated with this iteration. Modern Warfare 3 is an off-line spectacle and another splendid multiplayer game.", 
                "A worthy successor, spectacular, yet slightly problematic when it comes down to its AI. As MW3 offers a great experience and a strong multiplayer mode, it can be recommended.", 
                "By sticking to the series' strengths, Modern Warfare 3 delivers some of the best competitive, cooperate, and single-player shooting in the business.", 
                "Some will be disappointed by the fact that MW3 is not a drastic departure from previous iterations of the series and that is a very valid criticism. MW3 still offers so much content and still proves to be one of the best online experiences around. MW3 is a game that will certainly keep you busy until next year's release.", 
                "This time the single player campaign has definitely taken a backseat as it doesn't manage to offer the thrills of the previous installments. On the other hand, its excellent multiplayer will undoubtedly maintain the interest of the fans until the next installment.", 
                "This game plays well but there's a big lack of innovation. The multiplayer has shown some improvements but furthermore the game is exactly like you would expect.", 
                "A small evolution in multiplayer and a definitive end to the story. Despite being a solid, well-rounded experience, I felt there wasn't enough difference or progression in use of technology to really rate the game higher.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3, while still an excellent thrill ride in its own right, feels far too similar to MW2 or even Black Ops for my taste.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 still has the great, spectacular gameplay the Call of Duty series has become known for and Survival is a fantastic addition to an already very attractive package. It's just that Infinity Ward doesn't manage to surprise us anymore and graphically... well, let's just say that the engine starts showing its age.", 
                "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is exactly what we expected, and depending on your stance on the series that's either good or bad.", 
                "While it is abundantly clear that this game doesn't strive for innovation, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 gives players an overall entertaining game and delivers exactly what fans of the series want.", 
                "Modern Warfare 3 might be \"more of the same\", but that is not entirely a bad thing as it is a copy of a great game. The MW3 team has delivered a satisfying conclusion to the story introduced with the first Modern Warfare game, brought some great additions to the game's popular multiplayer and co-op modes – but the lack of innovation or real change means that the game is the least enjoyable game in the trilogy.", 
                "It will be yet another go-round on the same rollercoaster. And this time, to enjoy it fully, you won't have to measure up at a sign that says \"you must be this obsessed with multiplayer to ride this ride.\"", 
                "Sure, not much has happened in terms of gameplay, and if you've played any of the prequels you'll know exactly what to expect. But that doesn't stop Modern Warfare 3 from being a really entertaining piece of military action with excellent multiplayer to enjoy."

This review is primarily focused at the multiplayer (which I have loved both (COD 4: MW & MW2).Unfortunate to say MW3 is nowhere near as good as the previous games in terms of multiplayer, with the major drawback being the map design.

I seriously think when the **** hit the fan at IW all the map designers left because the 16 on offer are truly awful.

To give a game a 0 or a 1 score means that it is utterly unplayable, so their no excuse for giving this game those scorelines unless A) you have not played it and do not intend to because you are so hung up on BF3 or B) you wish to drive the score down intentionally.  Both are inexcusable.  It is clear that MW3 is a fantastic piece of software!  Universal accliam from critics should tell yo usomething.  Agreed, the series could use some freshening up, but to say that it is entirely stale is a gross misstatement.  The graphics are fantastic as always, the action is explosive and over the top and will keep you on your seat, and the multiplayer is a real treat.

Perhaps the worst I have ever seen in a game. Almost all are incredibly formulaic, and amount to \"go to these locations with this time limit\". Some missions must be thoroughly scoped (i.e., memorizing the positions of all important locations you must visit) and thus retried many times before victory is even possible, which to me seems ludacrous. Also, I'm very fond of GTA2, so I think the \"respect\" system and choice of gang you show your allegiance to was much more effective and advanced than the mission structure of this game, which is far more linear. Also, skirmishes between gangs on the streets do not occur often enough. Having to go through enemy territory on certain missions while being shot up is incredibly frustrating, given the already often excessive difficulty. The mechanics (especially shooting) are poorly designed and frustrating. Also, the inability to simply start a mission again from the beginning with the same equipment is bizzare. It's an okay game on the whole, but was and still is incredibly overrated and overappreciated. I really don't see how such a flawed game recieved such universally high reviews.… Expand",

                "From the fighting mechanics to roster of players Brawl is a well-rounded game that I just couldn't put down. The only downside to Brawl is that it doesn't do anything to reinvent the series. It takes elements of past SSB games and refines them, which is great, but players expecting an entirely new experience won't find it here.", 
                "From the digital-crack gameplay to the ocean-deep customization to the enjoyable Subspace Emissary, it's completely jam-packed with Nintendo love. The sights, the sounds, everything is an unfiltered pat on the back and incessant in-joke for longtime fans. For everyone else, it's a dependably solid fighter that destroys its predecessor in every way.", 
                "Brawl is a good game, with solid controls, a lot of options, and not-much-better-than-the-last-one-graphics. For the uninterested gamer, it's a curious diversion. For the Nintendo fanatic, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is like manna from heaven.", 
                "Never before has there been a game with more replayability then Super Smash Bros. Brawl.", 
                "Super Smash Bros. Brawl has lived up to the promise that has been dangled in front of us for so many years and should be snapped up by just about anyone willing to hold a controller.", 
                "The character models and animation are absolutely superb, the backgrounds seamless works of art and the gameplay easily the most diverse and enduring of any “fighting” game to date. I wouldn’t even classify it as a fighter. This is an action masterpiece.", 
                "The graphics are beautiful, the audio is clear, the online system is one of the best on the Wii in over a year and a half, the stages are varied, the mini-game experiences are time-consuming, the trophies are endless, the game is much more balanced and the new items are a blast.", 
                "Take into account the deep customization, barrage of unlockables and game modes, online components, and the polish and balance of it all, and Brawl is quite a force to be reckoned with, expanding those hours of value into months, if not years of good times.", 
                "But at the end of the day, no other game offers the wealth of content for a mere $50; and if early indications live up to their potential, we'll all be playing Brawl for another six-and-a-half years.", 
                "In a game where the amount of content is similar to the overwhelming amount of stuff in Japan on one's first visit, and that already managed to waste away hours on end before online play was included, it's safe to say that Super Smash Bros. Brawl has one heck of a lifespan.", 
                "Everything about this game is beautifully orchestrated and flawless in presentation.", 
                "Otherwise, it’s the absolute pinnacle of the Smash Bros. series and a fun game to boot.", 
                "Considering how much content you get before you ever even go online, this is easily one of the most generous, gratifying, and fun games you can get for the Nintendo Wii. Super Smash Brothers Brawl is nothing short of a smashing success.", 
                "Super Smash Bros. Brawl offers incredible value for money - there are masses of characters, levels and game modes to explore, the music is fantastic, the gameplay is superb and the production values are through the roof.", 
                "Smashtacular. Buy it, or regret it forever.", 
                "Although Super Smash Bros. Brawl will feel familiar to people who have played the game before, it's a lot harder to play this time.", 
                "Four different control options as well as an as-deep-as-you-want-it combat style mean that whether you’re a parent looking forward to seeing Mario and Sonic have a punch-up, or a Nintendo fan wanting the Nintendo Chronicle (of love), Brawl can offer you an outstanding game.", 
                "What else can I say other than you simply owe it to yourself to buy this game and treat yourself to one of the greatest multiplayer gaming experiences of all time. The only thing that stops me from giving it a perfect score is the not so perfect online mode.", 
                "Every aspect of the Smash Bros. series has been expanded. From the many interesting new characters to the tons of new items and stages to master, I don't see how any diehard fan can't be happy.", 
                "Brawl is fun, both alone and with friends, and if you’re a completist like me (completist: a gamer who refuses to stop playing a game until they have unlocked all the secrets and done everything there is to do), you’ll be looking at literally hundreds of hours of fun before you get even close to finishing.", 
                "The title's robust and balanced multiplayer offerings are completely engrossing and wholly entertaining from beginning to end, and this time around you can take those bouts to the online arena for similarly satisfying results.", 
                "Bottom line: Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a must-purchase for every single Wii owner. If you own a Wii, you have to own this game.", 
                "With a bigger roster than ever, online multiplayer, and the ability to share screenshots, custom levels, and game replays with friends, Super Smash Bros. has never been better.", 
                "In Brawl, Nintendo has handily produced one of the most compelling, rich and densely-packed experiences available on any console.", 
                "The core gameplay has remained largely unchanged since the N64 days, meaning we've essentially been playing the same game for nine years, and we'll be playing the same game for another five or six years, at least. Get it, appreciate it, and enjoy it.", 
                "With extremely tight controls and finely tuned balance, the core fighting mechanics and local multiplayer are spot on. There’s still nothing like learning the intricacies of every character, discovering possibly the most unlockables in any game yet, and using all of that to beat the crap out of your friends late into the night.", 
                "This is a game that reaches a fun factor which few games dare even dream of. It is absolutely packed to the gills with content, and features enough improvements over its predecessor to make it the best installment in the series by far.", 
                "The Subspace Emissary mode is a bit weak, the loading times are a bit hefty, and the online gameplay suffers from some lag and the usual Nintendo online awkwardness. However, those issues are far overshadowed by the excellence that permeates the rest of the game.", 
                "From the solid graphics, great sound to the nearly perfect gameplay, you really can’t find anything wrong with this game.", 
                "Super Smash Bros. Brawl is the type of game that actually delivers on every promise as well as exceeding every expectation.", 
                "As a game, it's brilliant; as an all-encompassing experience for Nintendo fans, it's quite possibly unsurpassed. [Issue#20, p.70]", 
                "While Super Smash Bros. Brawl does not offer very much in the way of innovation, it is one of those games that is so polished and so full of value that it is bound to sell well for quite some time.", 
                "Even looking at it with a cynical eye, it's incredibly hard to fault Brawl. You're going to adore this game. [July 2008, p.62]", 
                "It’s impeccably presented, lovingly crafted and absolutely incredible value for money.", 
                "The astonishing array of imaginative and well implemented characters, along with the hundreds of unlockable items to discover, ensure that SSB Brawl is easily the most definitive Smash Bros yet, and the best game you can buy for the Wii. But forcing you to unlock half of the characters and stages, not to mention the unbelievably botched online options, only serves to frustrate everyone who foresaw the greatness that could have been.", 
                "It’s not Melee 2...it’s something even better. Hundreds of extras, dozens of characters and an incredible multiplayer makes for the strongest candidate to game of the year for the Wii. Even if it doesn’t appeal to all of the casual audience, it’s a mandatory title for the console. We strongly recommend it. What else can we say? [Aug 2008]", 
                "More than a simple fighting game, it's fun to play and boasts high production values, capable of pleasing a vast audience of gamers.", 
                "The amazing amount of features and characters included in the game plus the online gameplay make Brawl one of Nintendo's best titles to date. Even those Nintendo fans who are not interested in fighting titles will find this one appealing.", 
                "Brawl is average if you intend to play it by yourself. As a multiplayer game, it nears perfection. Though the subspace emissary is a disappointment, the fast-paced fighting, bountiful modes and customization options, and a deep set of hidden content to be unearthed give it staying power that few other games possess.", 
                "In the simplest terms, Brawl makes Melee look like a demo sampler.", 
                "That said, Brawl still shines as the go-to party game for a houseful of friends. [May 2008, p.70]", 
                "Everything about his game - just about every little detail there is -  fits. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is here to stay – if you’ve waited for a reason to get yourself a Wii, here it is. Easy, fun and rewarding!", 
                "No more frustrating fiddling with vague motion sensing remote. Controls are accurate and Brawl supports almost any pad you can plug it in. It's fast and furious and on the bonus side, Super Smash Bros. Brawl suits perfectly for the beginners and advanced gamers. [June 2008]", 
                "Nintendo love spills from every pore and the multiplayer can't be beat, but Smash Bros risks growing too familiar. It never breeds contempt, but it doesn't quite muster that Galaxy magic.", 
                "With simple to use but tricky to master controls, a useful handicap feature and a staggering variety of great characters, Brawl is the perfect competitive party game.", 
                "Controlling Brawl with the remote's D-pad feels like the devil's work and even the remote/nunchuck pairing suffers from the lack of a second analog stick - you need it for quick smash attacks. It's playable with the Wii's controllers, but seasoned smashers should grab a Classic Controller or dust off their old GC gear. [Apr 2008, p.58]", 
                "The combat is all very smooth and familiar, and feels like a return to an old friend. But, when placing this combat into the intensely long Subspace Emissary mode, it doesn’t quite mesh.", 
                "In the end, Super Smash Bros. Brawl is just a superb game. While the single player alone will not last gamers forever, the size and amount of unlockable content make it a viable option when there is nobody around to play with.", 
                "Matches play like a Destroy All Monsters mêlée, with up to four players duking it out until the last man, or Pokémon, stands.", 
                "It’s hard to find a game out there for the Wii that provides more value for the money, or has more to see and do. The huge roster of well done, interesting characters combined with the wackiness of the in game items and the interactivity and challenges of the various stages packs the game full of memorable moments regardless of which portion of the game you decide to spend time with.", 
                "You might find that mastering some of controls can be a bear because Brawl's fighting game controls are being mapped over to a side-scrolling action platform game.", 
                "Super Smash Bros. Brawl isn't a giant leap forward from \"Super Smash Bros. Melee,\" but it didn't have to be. This is going to be the game that Wii owners will be playing for the life of the system, and they're going to love every minute of it.", 
                "Yeah, the graphics don't really go too far forward, the online options could've been less strenuous, and the load time could've been cut back. Regardless, there's still far greater good here than we could've ever expected from the game.", 
                "Super Smash Bros is a series that has often been unfairly derided as button-mashing, largely thanks to its surface sheen of cutesy characters, but it has one of the most enduringly innovative and deep systems of any fighter. [Apr 2008, p.84]", 
                "Overall, Super Smash Bros. Melee is still a frantic fighting game that's easy to pick up, has tons for you to do even in single-player mode, and it's still one of the best fighting games to pull out with company – with four players and intuitive controls, anyone can pick it up easily.", 
                "It truly is a unique game because it’s simple, and yet the concept will last you not only for hours or days, but weeks and months. If you can’t enjoy this game, stop playing video games.", 
                "Super Smash Bros. Brawl is one of the most fun multiplayer experiences you will have on any console. Period.", 
                "It's consistently satisfying over long periods, fulfilling its usual role of dominating a willing crowd's evening into the early hours, and now allowing you to sustain that after everyone's gone home using the Internet.", 
                "Epic, beautiful and quite wonderfully Nintendo in its almost sexual brilliance. Arousing stuff.", 
                "It’s not the best Nintendo game of all time, but thanks to the sheer amount of polished content packed within the disc, it is definitely the ultimate one. [May 2008, p.98]", 
                "Brawl isn't perfect. The single-player mode isn't nearly as polished and fun as the multiplayer. The disc is crammed so full of content that the loading times can get annoying. But it's still without equal -- can you even think of another four-player fighting game?", 
                "With an epic online mode, dozens of unlockable characters and stages and hundreds of collectible trophies, Brawl deserves its place in every Wii-owner's collection.", 
                "If you can grin and bear your predictably initial lacklustre performance, you'll soon realise you're within the grasp of one of the greatest Wii games to date.", 
                "Brawl has the most characters, is the best balanced, delivers the most and generally trumps both the other games so far.", 
                "This game is huge in entertainment value and a tour de force for the Nintendo stable of characters. Its many game options and the full-on combat make it a game you will come back to again and again. Highly recommended for any Wii owner.", 
                "Although the singleplayer mode has been improved, the game is most fun if played together with friends.", 
                "Whoever's heart skipped a beat at the simple thought of seeing all these characters together should eye this game as an instant purchase. If you have no special connection to the characters, the game still offers a competent battle system and a slew of modes, that amount to hundreds of hours of gameplay.", 
                "Nintendo has done it again, creating another “must-have” Wii game built on an old franchise.", 
                "Arenas are wonderfully bizarre...I was especially taken by an arena based on the Wario Ware games, where combatants periodically take breaks from battle to dodge objects or chisel statues.", 
                "Despite its absolutely luminal reception, there is a strong argument that Brawl will appeal to the two polar opposites of the gaming community but fall flat to the majority of 'middle class' gamers in between. The very casual gamer will enjoy the chaos and the pyrotechnics, the hardcore gamer will love the bizarre mojo they can discover to gain their edge, but the middle of the road party player will probably soon tire of the impetus of play without being able to access the deeper mysteries.", 
                "So, yes—the online functionality is a little on the shallow, blunted side compared to that of its next-gen console peers, and there are some offputting load times…but these are minor complaints. There’s so much here in the way of cool details, nifty items and ubiquitous, understated fan service that it’s a little difficult to grade Brawl’s raw gameplay without factoring in the Nintendo-culture saturation factor.", 
                "Despite having an online mode that disappoints in nearly every respect, Smash Bros Brawl gets everything else right.", 
                "The questions you need to ask yourself before deciding to invest in Super Smash Bros. Brawl concern your own personal level of love for Nintendo’s rich history and your ability to rustle up enough enthusiastic locals to get into the multiplayer. If both of those are in your favor, then this is definitely a game you’ll want to add to your collection. But if you aren’t big in either department, you probably won’t understand what all the fuss is about in the first place.", 
                "Perhaps by being willing to limit itself, Brawl could have been a great game. As it stands, it is simply the strongest iteration of a great series.", 
                "Nintendo's third entry in the Smash Bros series isn't just a trip down nostalgia lane - it's also a heck of a fun experience. With an insane amount of content and a gameplay begging for sessions with a bunch of friends this is a perfect addition to the series. A somewhat dodgy online mode and random events during fights mar this otherwise fantastic and frantic experience.", 
                "If you've got a few like minded friends to play with you, this is some of the best fun you can have with your Wii yet. Single players will be left scratching their heads wondering what the hubbub is really all about."

The control scheme is much improved over Melee, however I've got to take a point away for the not quite as good control with the Wii remote. A lot of the new aspects of the game, however, such as the finishing moves, are simply amazing. The game is not for the story of what happens, or even the moves or level design. No, what makes this fighting game so great is two little things: 1. Anyone can pick it up and play it. Yes, the game goes deep and you can really master a particular character, but the straight up moves that take about a minute to learn apply to all characters. 2. This game is about FUN. Nothing else. You get together with a bunch of friends and play the heck out of each other. Playing it alone is nice, yes, but fighting lifeless AI gets boring after a while. (Fortunately, the AI is competent enough to give you a challenge, even if you do have a good mastery of a character.) When picking up this game to play with friends, there's no intensity (unless you're playing with a bunch of hardcores) to win.

From the moment I first saw the preview for this game -- yep, almost three years ago -- I thought \"Wow, this game might actually be better than Melee!\". Fast-forward to getting the game two years later. My first thoughts when I played it? \"Holy crap. This IS better than Melee.\" The aspects that Melee had that made it such a great game are only made better by Brawl. With a new roster of characters (like Snake and Sonic), a slew of new stages (and the chance to create your own), and online capabilities, this may be the best Wii game yet. The single-player mode, for the most part, is lacking -- aside from the Subspace Emissary, I found no changes. But the one-player game isn't what I play Brawl for. It's the multiplayer. With 37 characters, matchups can be anywhere from classic (think Mario, Luigi and Peach versus Bowser) to downright hilarious. (Kirby, Pikachu, Sonic, and Mr. Game and Watch in a taunt match? Score!!) And what about the Wi-Fi capabilities? Although they are a tiny bit limited, it is nice to be able to face people who could be 12,000 miles away -- or just down the road -- without leaving your couch.

You are obviously a complete noob who played the game and spammed then complained that the game sucked. Well here's a real review of someone who was been playing the game and is still playing after nearly a year. Firstly graphics Ray A you have to be a completely retarded stupid ass 360 fanboy to hate this game. None of your points were vaild at all. Everything you said was bullcrap. You are obviously a complete noob who played the game and spammed then complained that the game sucked. Well here's a real review of someone who was been playing the game and is still playing after nearly a year. Firstly graphics wise it is amazing. All of the textures and animations are very crisp and you can really notice all of the changes (even the rather subtle ones) from Melee. Furthermore the backgrounds for each stage are very well done. Whether it's the castle in Bridge of Eldin or the sunset landscape in Final Destination, each has been done to a high standard. Now onto the soundtrack which really deserves top marks. Take a load of the best Nintendo tunes, remix them to sound even better, chuck in a few more kick ass tunes and you have a near perfect soundtrack. Now onto gameplay. The single player experience is pretty good. Subspace Emissary is pretty good (especially the boss fights) although it only lasts about 9-10 hours. There is also your typical Classic mode and an improved stadium where you can do Target Test, Home Run Contest, Event Matches and Boss Rush. However Super Smash Bros has never been about single player. The multiplayer is what really makes it shine and it by far has the bulkiest and probably the best multiplayer of all Wii games. Whether it's facing off against a CPU or beating the hell out of your mates there is always fun to be found. There are also a huge amount of stages as well as an awsome stage creator to make your own stages. It's quite spectacular how Sakurai (the creator) was able to fit all this in. There is so much more awsome stuff to discuss but I simply can't write it all. This is an absolute MUST BUY. If you have a Wii and don't have it, GET IT NOW.… Expand",

Okay, it's called a DAMAGE METER, shows how much damage you have.(obviously) Also, just because a game has Master *Cheif* (Not Chef) doesn't mean that it's gonna be excellent, when the lego Halo that bungie's working on comes out, youcan go get it, I'll pass. Also it's not a shooting game! It's a fighter! and, you have the contols set to just the one wii controll, not even the nunchuk, so you have to tilt it over! (again, oviously) this game wasn't even built for these kinds of controls, or even the wii-mote in general, so anybody who gives this game a bad review because of controller issues, you can just be grouped in the same category as \"cheify\" over there. This game was built with either the classic controller or primarily the gamecube controller (My personal favorite, then again, I had been playing melee it's release up until this game came out.)\r ...Anyways. In my opinion this game isn't perfect, the characters, as many melee players may have noticed,ARE slower paced, which is actually somewhat nice  or 1 on 1's. otherwise, but for 4 player action, it seems a tad akward. not a big complain really once you  get used to it. also, don't judge the subspace emissary a representation of this game as a whole. iI's obviously meant  for beating the crap out of your friends, at which, it's superb. In fact, it's easily my favorite fighting game since the last SSB because it's one of the simplest fighting games to learn (No large and tedious combo's and special moves to look up) but still incorporates a large amount of skill once you start getting better at the game. and all of the extra content is astounding, the subspace emmissary, the huge selection of music, (customisable for each stage in fact) the improvement of ceratin characters and character selection, the stage building, along with all of the already nice stages, the inclusion of online, (however poor), The cool final smashes, and the trophy game, (And LOADS of trophies) make this game absoloutely astounding. \rSome of my complaints though would have to be that I thought they should have added a frequency selection for each individual item, as there were way to many smash balls and other overpowered items, which made brawls, especially the four player ones, too erratic.also you should have had the option to go through an ethernet cable for online as well. For those of us without WI Fi, (I happen to currently be using some unknown neighbors internet connection for the game, quite laggy.) and that each character doesn't have an individual target test, the ___ man brawls are battling used character models,  and the home run test is too easy with the force field, (All you have to do is throw the bat!) Still, all minor compaints compared to all of the prelisted extras.These make this game a 10, and more than enough to keep me playing Super Smash Bros. games for another 6 to 7 years.… Expand",

It makes me want to build a robot puppy-body so that I can upload the puppy AI and beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Bad puppy!. Where was I? Oh, right. Fun! Fun! Fun! Most of the bad stuff has an option to turn it off. Refreshing!\r Levels:\rThe levels feel smaller than in previous games, and I it's a pity that more old stages weren't brought forward into this iteration.I haven't engaged in level-building, but I expect it will help somewhat in remedying this, though the levels obviously won't have the soul and quirky events that mix things up in official levels.\r Characters:\rThe characters are still stellar, adding more to the roster, but cutting a few in the process. I don't see why everyone couldn't have come to the party... Most of your old favourites are back, and everyone looks slick. Some, you'll like, and some, you'll hate. Everyone will find three or four favourites and use those to build a reputation among friends and family.\r Under-the-hood tinkering:\rI understand that some of what were termed \"balance issues\" (otherwise known in loftier circles as \"Captain Falcon wins\") have been corrected, and I'll grant that handling is a bit different from Melee, but overall, everything still feels about right. Some go on about the removal of the exploitable glitch that allowed a technique known as \"wave-dashing\", but I think this is good. Wave-dashing is dumb, and the fact that tournaments devolved into obsessive-compulsive mastering of this technique makes me glad I had nothing to do with that nonsense. It makes the game look and sound terrible when you're playing. What's wrong with you?

The two major downsides to the game is the low replayablity it has, and the fact that \"Microsoft fanboys\" (looks that way for most bad ratings, since a stupid person among them said that Halo 3 has more guns, etc.; how did that get there?) will rate it badly for no apparant reason (Ex.: a guy in the reviews said \"you can't even see your own HP\", which is the reason to his low score; wow). Single-player, on the other hand, is the one thing that raises the bar for SSBB. SSE (one guy among the reviews said \"Space Station Emassary,\" lol). It actually is the best thing in the game, but it only lasts for less than 5 hours if you want to finish quickly. Then again, raise the bar to Intense mode on it and you got a killer 'sub'-game (i.e., 2 games in one; perfect). Also, Intense mode on any game mode (Boss Battles, for example) makes any mode extremely challenging, but frustrating, and that makes me come back for more. AI is incredible, to say the least. On Level 9 AI in 4-Vs., Sonic, for example, is jawdroping. He seriously goes nuts on the stage, making him an excellent fighter to fight against. My personal favorite in the game is Lucario, since his attacks can be more powerful to a point where he's over-powered (300% and Last-place can instant-KO anyone over 50%). And you do not want to miss out on Snake's Codec messages: they're too hilarious. I believe it's the single-player that's better than the multi-, since there's not a lot of variation between the fighters (3 Fox Clones?!). If only Nintendo removed the clones in the game, or at least made the clones different from each other (Toon Link to have the Phantom Hourglass would've been great), then it would've gotten a higher score.

Most games just add things to make a game longer and usually force you to complete While the game is mixed graphically, it's clearly a step up from the GameCube game, but not by as much as most would have thought; although, the sheer amount of content in the game and the amount of new content in the game, all of which is enjoyable, really adds to the entire gameplay experience. Most games just add things to make a game longer and usually force you to complete useless tasks so you can say you spent that money of yours properly because of the time you spent in the game. The worst part is, it's obvious Sakurai doesn't favor the Wiimote at all. Being a veteran Smash player w/ over 9600 hours in Melee and quite a few in the first game, I can clearly state that the Wiimote/Nunchuck combo is already the favorite of mine. My complaint lies in Sakurai's hatred of the Wiimote and most developer's candid use of it. It was used well in Resident Evil 4, Zelda: Twilight Princess, and Super Mario Galaxy to name a few yet, Super Smash Bros. Brawl doesn't even have pointer functionality. I found myself constantly moving the pointer as well as the analog stick to point at objects on the screen, even when realizing I was doing it because it is so natural to point at things with the controller. I quit playing Melee for the last couple years because of the controls becoming boring as I was hitting the limits of the controller itself. I still thing Brawl is fun and that's really all that matters, but could it have hurt to at least play around w/ some innovative Wiimote functionality? Adding in waggle for smash attacks is the same as allowing smash attacks on the C-Stick; it just makes players claim it is cheating thus making it unusable unless you play alone or with beginners. But much of the game was improved and the balancing is even far better than the last game which only had balance problems because of glitch exploits, at least from my experience. The AI has improved greatly so much so that it's smart and not just so inhuman where you would pull off a fully charged blaster special attack using Samus and the AI would immediately block or dodge it as if it was reading the button presses in your mind. It wasn't always like that, but 90% of the time it was. It's good to know that Brawl at least lets playing with the AI not get boring even though they added in online play. Bonus mode was also exempt from this game as well as more Solo modes and variations of them. It would've added more to the single-player experience most players have who do not play online. This game deserves a 10 for fun, but a 0 for innovation. I don't think it's fair to grade a game on it's failure to innovate, but in this day and age, especially on the Wii, use the Wiimote and use it well just as only a handful of Wii games have. I guess I would have to say then, it's better to not include something you couldn't get right, but at least include what you could have (pointer functionality in the menus).… Expand",

Critics are raving about this game wherever you turn, but the real story is that the game is quite lacking and hopefully it's garbage enough that Activision has finally slaughtered the golden goose they've been milking for the past 3 years.\r Graphics, sound design, and AI characteristics are on par with Call of Duty 2 from 2005.  While no FPS to date seems to strive for super realistic AI; MOH and BFBC2 at least have better graphics and sound design.  At what point does intensity just become annoying... with an explosion every two seconds and being knocked down with fuzzy vision 3 times a level and more bullets flying than were fired in all of WW2...

I'd love to have a record of any epic moments. Unlocking many items, upgrades, and perks through purchases is a plus for me as well. The weak graphics are an embarrassment to the makers. I think the game would look pretty much the same in standard definition. Back in 2004, these graphics might have been neat-o, but in 2010 they're a bit hokey. The sound is also disappointing. Most everything that explodes, as an example, has a sort of generic \"pop.\" With regard to gameplay, I agree with another reviewer who said Black Ops feels clunky and unresponsive, lacking the smoothness and fluidity I now realize I took for granted in Modern Warfare 2. As a matter of fact, Black Ops' biggest impact on me has been to help me realize just how great MW2 is. A few minutes ago--and without remorse--I decided to sell my copy of Black Ops to a friend. There are too many good PS3 games out there for me to force myself to love a mediocre one.… Expand", 
                "I was looking forward to this game after reading about all the new features it promised online.

As I am at Uni, I play a lot of split screen mw2 with friends so when I read 'bots in splitscreen' I thought great now we can play team matches rather than all v all. When I got the game, I find that the graphics are worse, the gameplay is slow and boring, the splitscreen offline is limited to no bots with only player 1 being able to create a profile with classes, you START with all the guns unlocked (wtf?) which removes any incentive to play, and only player 1 can even use killstreaks whilst on splitscreen. Furthermore, to fully utilise the splitscreen mode (bots, profiles, unlocks etc.), you need to be logged in to the PS Network, which makes no sense at all seeing as the game you start then, is hosted on your own PS3 not online. I mention being at Uni because I cannot connect to the internet on the PS3, hence playing splitscreen, hence massive annoyance at the 'Online local splitscreen' seriously what a joke. Even the splitting of the screen is done badly as with 3 people the 3rd player's screen doesn't fill the whole bottom half. Why not? Its not like i'm playing profesionally with 2 other professionals for money or something. use the whole damn screen.\r The online multiplayer mode is the home of the only new content in the game, and it is good, wager mode is fun and gives new urgency to games. However, all of the equipment, perks and costumes, are dull. None of the guns are as pleasing as the ones in mw2, the snipers look like peashooters and make a similar noise, the M16 looks like a toy and the general sounds of battle are essentially the same bang noise over and over again. None of the perks are appealing, in mw2, you wanted all the perks at once and sometimes took a while to choose which one was best, in Black Ops, 80% are dull and useless and you end up making every class with the same perks and equipment. The costume idea is new, but stupid, as you have to change it every map to blend in. Granted zombie mode is back, this is fun as most people know from WaW. But honestly, 1 map...the same thing over and over again until they make me pay more money for a new one. It's not worth it, and if I wanted zombie mode to be the best part of the game I would just go and play Left 4 Dead...\r Ok so the final mode is the Campaign. After having a long few hours trying to make the best of the crap splitscreen and multiplayer games, I decided to start this up figuring it might redeem the game. I get 30 minutes into the first mission, the guy 'Woods' who i'm supposed to 'support' freezes and cant move just moving his pixelly mouth up and down making no sound. Essentially, a bug. I think ok, should be fine if i revert to the previous checkpoint like i'm sure you can do from the menu. Oh wait...you cant. Looks like a restart of the whole mission. F**k that *turns PS3 off*.\r Overall the gameplay is slower, worse looking, more boring, more repetitive and less fun than all the other Call of Dutys. Regardless of the fact that 99.9% of the content is made up of the previous 3 put together. I am very disappointed with this game and would not recommend it to fans of mw2 or WaW because it isn't as good. Oh yeah and also, they got rid of quickscoping (something fun).....and replaced it with something much more annoying.....the Crossbow. Enjoy, noob tube fans.… Expand",

                "Let me start by saying I am going to be as fair and unbiased as possible with this review. I am 22 years of age and I thoroughly enjoy the CoD series and each new game captures at least 3-4 full days of my attention worth of game play.I am currently at about 3 and a half days (according to their online leaderboard statistics) of online game play and I feel that is more than enough timeLet me start by saying I am going to be as fair and unbiased as possible with this review. I am 22 years of age and I thoroughly enjoy the CoD series and each new game captures at least 3-4 full days of my attention worth of game play.I am currently at about 3 and a half days (according to their online leaderboard statistics) of online game play and I feel that is more than enough time to submit a fair review. I have read some of the reviews here and I have to disagree with the blatant disregard for innovation and substance that this game has to offer.What Treyarch seems to do well with their CoD games is to add a compelling multi-player that is much more likely to addict the average player than that of the Infinity Ward titles. What MW2 did completely wrong is the absolute lack of enjoyment when playing against a dominant team; what Black Ops has done well is add multiple functions to make this game fun for a wider audience and much more balanced than previous CoD titles.Yes, there are some serious connectivity issues, and menu glitches that need to be fixed, but there is a new update daily if not multiple times a day to solve some of these problems. I cannot review the single player because I have only played about a quarter of the missions because I am so addicted to the multiplayer. One thing I suggest for people who enjoy previous CoD titles is to allow some time to get into the game. Do not expect your first 10 games to be instantly enjoyable or for you to be getting 10.0 kill to death ratios like some of the people online. This game has a very very high learning curve in which brand new players will likely fall short if they do not give it a little time to adjust to such a fast paced and small environment.Another thing that most people should know is that there are hundreds, maybe thousands or even hundreds of thousands of different custom class possibilities... This leaves you so many options that makes it possible for you to find your little niche in the combat zone, don't give up just because you fell short the first 5 games you played. Another thing I'd like to mention is that the best 3 weapons in the game do are not unlocked until level 20, 38, and 44... So if you read a review about someone who has only reached level 19 (coughhhh, the reason I am making this review coughhh) then you are being mislead by someone who is either terrible at FPS games or is just too impatient to give this game a chance.Overall Black Ops runs well and plays well. The multiplayer is FAR MORE FUN than Modern Warfare 2 due to the fact that there is no game-ending killstreak (Nuke-cough cough) and even when there is a person in the game waving their over-experienced 20 and 0 ratio in your face... grab a rocket launcher and knock down their damn killstreaks... plain and simpleSome buggy things that may eventually be patched... The knifing in this game is (in my opinion) worse than any other CoD I've ever played (I've been playing since CoD 3), and the lag and server connect issues can be bothersome after a while. Often you will hear two or three *plink* sounds (meaning headshot) but the enemy player will either not die or will take at least one more shot (this might be purposeful and class based, but its frustrating). Lastly, if you are an avid player and you typically do very well... find yourself a party of people you trust because random kids always seem to disappoint, and more often than not yell, scream, talk crap, or just plain and simply make the game not fun at all.My vote... Give it a fair chance and I think an 8 rating is a conservative estimate on this game....Lastly, if you have an Xbox 360... do yourself a favor and buy it for that console... the PS3 version is a port and is slightly more buggy, and I have no idea about how well the PC version runs.… Expand",

For MW2 players you noticed shotguns are missing from this list. well they decided to throw them into primary class. The shotguns are for screwing around and are not that great. there seem to be less weapons and not nearly as many combinations. under barrel add ons disable the ability to add anything else to the assault rifle. only 4 light machines,only 4-5 shotguns(dont remember). add ons are also toned down along with the perks. pro is harder to unlock and often not worth it. the only reall good thing about online is currency. they did a good job with balance and player cards are expensive, but fun to create. Final mode is the zombies. It comes with 2 maps(unlock 1 after sinlge player) and another zombie mode that is good for a little while. the maps are small and cramped making it difficult to move and reach high levels. the new monster nova zombie(what i call it) will explode with nova gas after killed. this combined with tight areas make it even worse. the weapon selection is also decreased, but upgraded. Finally something everyone will love! in zombies they took out the wonderwaffle! so ya they kinda screwed up zombies but it can still be fun for hardcore zombie fans. overall the game should be rented before bought.

With Black Ops entering the fray, I think Call of Duty fans will have mixed reactions to Treyarch's latest installment. If you've been playing CoD ever since Modern Warfare came out, a clearer and more learned stand on how Black Ops fares may be obtained. A lot of players were disappointed at how some aspects of Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops' predecessor, seemed too unrealistic for an FPS game. From Commando to Marathon and even how kills gotten from killstreaks enable you to get a higher killstreak reward, I would say a lot of users were pissed. Thus, Treyarch listened to the fans' cries and they listened real good. If one had experienced Modern Warfare 2's online gameplay, he would be able to tell that Black Ops' is starkly different. I dare say that Black Ops is more balanced when it comes to online multiplayer. The removal of Stopping Power, Commando and Danger Close among other perks is just one of the things Treyarch has done. Therefore, if you're the arcade-FPS type, Black Ops is a superb game if you're sick and tired of MW2. However, CoD's pseudo-lone wolf play style still remains as Bad Company 2 wins the more team-based gameplay.The online mode is only one aspect of the game and Treyarch definitely didn't want to end there. Black Ops' solo campaign is a more creative and psychological take on military drama than Modern Warfare. It delves into unknown territory as you are taken into the Cold War's secret skirmishes. The campaign offers a lot of promising and fun gameplay as seen in the parts where the player controls various vehicles and guns.The Zombies mode is also a decent approach to giving players a break from competing with each other and instead, working together to defend against an outrageously weaved zombie apocalypse story. The zombies mode replaces the superb Spec Ops of Modern Warfare 2 but it isn't in any way any better or worse.With all the tweaks on online gameplay and extra content, Treyarch has put up a surprisingly well-made Call of Duty sequel that may actually rival the peak performance of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. For CoD fans, and those who have had enough of Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops is a decent bang for your buck.… Expand",

Zombies is great and is very enjoyable and it just never gets old. However, there were two downsides. One was that the AI is incredibly stupid. I mean seriously, you can't get much dumber. The other one I had was with a glitch in Combat Training, a new addition to the Call of Duty Multiplayer which allows you to practice the maps with the AI which you can play with a friend. When you start, it puts you (and your friend) on a different team. When I try and switch to the same team as my friend, it switches from the usual six players on a team to eight, meaning that the other team had seven originally.

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nIs it just your normal first person shooter or something special? Call of duty black ops released November 9th by developer Treyarch the developers behind Call of Duty: World at War and Call of Duty 3. Black ops has one of the best story's ever in a Call of Duty game, because after the blunder of the multiplayer based game Modern Warfare 2's almost insulting campaign, I think Call of Duty fans got what they deserved. You play as Alex Mason and you are interrogated so your interrogators can find out the numbers in your head to SAVE THE WORLD! Cliche? Maybe, but it sure is fun. The campaign should last you about 6 hours so it is not the longest game in the world. But the meat of the game comes from the multiplayer. Surprisingly it is a lot more balanced then modern warfare 2's multiplayer. The killstreaks are fun and nice and balanced. One big thing I noticed with the kill streaks is if you have a player on your team having a aircraft in the sky which means you cannot call in your killstreak till that aircraft is out of the sky. Leveling up is easy as well, maybe to easy. Not like battlefield bad company 2 where I just got the game and I am still a level 1 and I have had the game for a week! The new cod points system is a big change to unlocking to unlocking then buying. All killstreaks are unlocked at level 10 and either you love the new system or hate the new system. The only problem I have with the multiplayer is being kicked out of a match or the host left all that stuff that you thought was bad in Modern Warfare 2...is back and worse it is a minor problem but with some people it can be troublesome. The new wager mode is added to this multiplayer and wow it is extremely fun and may be addicting that is how fun this is. Because I played gun game for a straight 3 hours it is that fun, and sometimes and I did not even care how much cod points I had left. 1 in the chamber is one of those games that your having fun when you are winning but when you are losing and you lost all 3 of your lives its not fun after that but if you are a real skilled cod player this may be the mode for you because it is as fun and addicting as the gun game. That is just to name a few modes in the wager mode, moving on we have theater mode where you can grab all the matches that you played watch it on theater mode and then save it so your friends can watch your sexy no scope. Combat training is for new cod fans where you get all the regular modes from the regular multiplayer but against ai team mates and they could be just as deadly as their online counterparts. The guns are a lot more balanced then mw2 even though the ak7u could be over powered and then you have the emblem editor which shows off your personal creativity which I like. That is just to scrape the surface of such a fantastic multiplayer experience. Now onto the extra content you can press both triggers on your controller and you walk to the computer and put a pass code and you are treated to a top down arcade shoot \"dead ops arcade\" but if you type in \"zorks\" you can play a fun game with the computer. Now to NAZI ZOMBIES! It is your old favorite characters from waw are back and they do not disappoint. Easily one of the best mini games on a video game to date. You get 2 zombie maps in the game \"Kino der Toten/Cinema of the dead\" and \"five.\" Five is unlocked after beating the campaign and before you play five after the campaign you see a pretty funny cut scene between some historical figures. That is just to scrape the surface of black ops and it does not disappoint easily one of the best shooters of the year and surpasses the 60$ asking price with all stuff that is included in the game. If you are strictly a modern warfare 2 fan I would not say go out and buy the game since there are many changes to the games multiplayer but if you are a big cod fan yes go out and buy this game if you don't have it already.

                "The verdict is in and Black Ops is in line with previous Treyarch second rate disappointments. Zombies? BFD. Give me awesome action and gameplay any day and for that you gotta go to Infinity Ward. That said, the Campaign mode is quite good here, so I'll give 'em points for that.",

Now that its here, people cant decide if they like it or not. You either think MW2 was better (which that dosnt make sense, because no matter where u looking someone was bashing MW2 for being \"too glitched\" or \"has too many fanboys\". or you love this game. It the context of things, this game really will make hardcore fans cringe or jump for joy. What should be said is that this game looks fantastic. Comparison to MW2, this game tried to hold back on the polished visuals for the realistic sense, but still looks amazing. Its useless to go on about gameplay, you either love it or hate it, simple as that. Story in my opinion is better because you focus on one person, not multiple sides. This makes the story flow and you feel more for the characters then jumping back and forth from one person to the next. Mulitplayer is the big selling point, but also is why most people are split. For the first time, a COD game incorporated some RPG element into the game, letting you customize everything but the shape of your body. There is now a money system, where you gain 'money' after a match and completing challenges. These may be to much for the hardcore shooter fans who only want to kill and not worry about how much that new gun is going to cost. I grew up with RPGs, while i dont play them anymore i do appreciate the customization and freedom you have, you really do feel like its your person now. The maps are very well done, though some are more popular then others. One thing i noticed is just how many ideas are taken from another big shooter franchise, Halo. The ability to 'vote' on the map you play next and heavy customization are almost identical to the system Halo: Reach uses. This is not a bad thing, this system is really good, but it feels like some elements were pretty much stolen. The last part to this game is Zombies, made popular to WaW. Only this time you can play online with up to 4 people. This is my favorite part of the pack, very addictive and fun. This game feeling like your are being given three games in one, and you have a 1 out of 3 chance of finding something you like. Is this game perfect for everyone? No, as you can see by the mulitiple 'negative' and 'mixed' reviews, not everyone feels the same about this game.

The poor graphics were the first thing I noticed.  A sequel should at least maintain the same level of quality in graphics, if not improve upon them. The sound quality also seems below par compared to MW2.  These aren't even my biggest complaints. I could overlook the sound and graphics if the gameplay was improved.  In my opinion the maps are not designed as well as those in MW2.  MW2 maps have more variety and combine close quarters fighting, sniping, etc... into the same maps. Because of the map design I can't find a reason to use the sniper rifles on any of the Black Ops maps.  The spawn system is much worse than in MW2, especially in team deathmatch.  I thought the spawn system was one of the major issues they were supposed to address in this game.  Also, apparently they haven't stopped boosters and other cheaters.  Within a few hours of release I was playing against people who were level 48 or 50. Really????WTF??? And as far as noob tubers and campers, I have been noob tubed more in one week of playing than I have been in my last several months of playing MW2. Also, camping is still a big problem. I think that in order to get their 9 or 11 kill streaks people are camping more than ever. The kill streaks are seriously overpowered.  The chopper gunner and gunship lay waste to the other team on these small maps. I do not understand why they put the \"dolphin dive\" or \"dive to prone\" or whatever they want to call it in the game.  All that move is good for is getting killed.  All they have succeded in doing is messing up the smooth gameplay of MW2.  The feel of the guns is not as good as MW2. The guns all feel similar.  Each gun in MW2 had its own personality. They have also ruined the sniper rifles. Now when you scope in the crosshairs are off target and you have to correct.  This was done to stop quickscopers.  I don't quickscope, but this ruins it for me too.  You are at way too much of a disadvantage using a sniper rifle. There seems to be many redundant or useless attachments  for the guns.  The ACOG sight would be an example of this. The ACOG sight has no magnification and there is an annoying reflection and fisheye effect when you look through the lens that obscures your view. You are better off with iron sights. In general the attachments in MW2 were better and actually did something for the gun. The gun customization also seems to be a joke.  You can clownify your gun with wacky colors/camo and emblems. You can also clownify your character with facepaint. Now those are some great innovations that have improved the game! I am a fan of first-person shooters and the Call of Duty franchise in general, but this game is not better than MW2 or any of the other preceding Call of Duty games.  I am shocked at the lack of honest reviews.  I guess there are a lot of fanboys out there and it is not in the interest of the gaming media to not promote this game.  I hope people continue to play MW2, because thats were I'll be until something better comes out.… Expand",

The single player campaign is as intense as ever as you battle through deadly scenarios set in the cold war. Because this installment is set in the Cold War, Treyarch is no longer limited to WW2 history and the guns they have to design. There is a massive selection of arsenal to use including AK-47's and Ballistic Knife's and the sound design of these guns is probably the best I've heard in the series. The graphics are fantastic to use in both Single player and Multiplayer and some levels in the single player campaign's environments are massive (although you are still restricted to a linear path sadly) and adds to the war intensity of the atmosphere. The character models and faces are so realistic and fluid and the motion capture is so well done. The story is told through flashbacks which can be annoying sometimes because the flashbacks interrupt the game play at times but it is a good way to present the story. I do prefer this campaign to Modern Warfare 2. Multiplayer is where this game is at: It seems to be (to me) more balanced than Modern Warfare 2. There's no stupid game ending killstreaks (Tactical Nuke) or stupid AC-130's raining death from above but the RC-XD killstreak can get on my nerves sometimes. The maps are nicely designed and Black Ops brings new equipment to Multiplayer like the Camera Spike and Nova Gas to the mix to make the multiplayer even more interesting. A nice touch is that now you purchase guns, equipment, Perks and weapon attachments with Black Ops currency system instead of unlocking things as you level up. Currency can be earned by regularly playing Multiplayer and getting kills, completing challenges or leveling up. Gambling is introduced into Black Op's in the form of Wager Matches in which you put forward some of your currency and take part in Wager Matches and try to win more currency and this provides some tense battles where you can either win and buy some more stuff or lose and have to build up your currency bank again. The currency system means you can purchase what you want and play the game how you want to play it which is great. This gives you more freedom of choice: What guns you want, what perks you want etc. Customisation is taken further by letting you apply face paints to your character, customise red dot/ reflex sights (colour, sights etc), add your clan tag to your gun, design symbols for your gun and your gun colour pattern which are awesome so you can let your artistic skills go wild and really make your classes your own and unique. There are a few problems though: Treyarch didn't add any new multiplayer modes which is a shame: Black Ops justs cuts and pastes multiplayer modes from MW and MW2 and adds pretty much nothing of it's own. The Zombie Mode from World at War is also present in this game but has received very few tweaks but it provides some co-op fun with your friends. The spawning needs sorting out: At times I seem to spawn and then shortly get killed again. The Chopper Gunner killstreak is really annoying as well: Really frustrating when you spawn and then get killed by a Chopper gunner and then spawn then suddenly get killed again. Some of the matches I've been in have been really laggy and it's such a pain at times. The single player was at times disappointing and doesn't really offer much more than previous Call of Duty games although it does offer some intense set pieces. Call of Duty: Black Ops slices some frustrations from Modern Warfare 2 but the series is starting to grow tired now.â… Expand",

Game play:Not great, not bad.  In comparison to Modern Warfare 2 (which I thought was brilliant) they screwed up a few key elements.  For one, when running then attempting to slouch into a prone position, instead, now you do a Superman jump and baseball slide an extra couple of body lengths from where you expected to be prone.  Also, they changed the function of the d-pad to control more of the introduced elements, in a very annoying way.  I team killed a few people when erroneously throwing semtex near them, instead of placing a claymore.  Which brings me to...Features:While having a lot more to offer than previous titles in the way of customization, many of those features are useless in multiplayer.  Worse, there is a lot of ambiguity amongst all the assault rifles and sub machine guns.  Unless it's one of the 3-round burst weapons, or single shot, the differences between the automatic weapons are a split hair from one another.  Sniper rifles are next to useless in multiplayer.  Partially because none of them offer much advantage over their single-fire assault rifle counterparts.  Partially because recoil and idle sway ruin any attempt for a refire or second hit.  And partially because staying hidden and remote enough to make a scoped, slow weapon useful is impossible. Shotguns are too limited in range, and don't offer enough punch to make them effective in anything but urban maps in hardcore mode. For all of these faults, there should be some gaming worth playing in COD:BO multiplayer, but unfortunately it plays really, really badly.  As evidenced in many a kill-cam, persons killed without being hit, knife thrusts that strike at shadows of enemies somehow getting the win.  Of course this is all a product of lag, and poor connections, but its so pervasive in Black Ops that it infuriates and frustrates to no end. To this end, the game would have scored a full 3 or 4 points higher for me if more attention had been payed to making multiplayer sharp. At the end of the day, once you've beaten the campaign, and you want to play the other $50 of your $60 game, multiplayer is only worth about $6.50.… Expand",

The entire story is told through flashbacks of Mason. It is a very different story unlike the previous COD games, mainly because it feels more like something out of CSI rather than war games. The campaign at times is majorly intense and this is not a good thing seeing as it just seemed like it was non-stop action all the way through, making it exahasting. Though when I finished it, all became clear, and I definately found myself inspired by the campaign, as I do feel more lucky to be alive now i've played it.The multiplayer side is rather the same as the previous games, with perks and unlockable guns, but this time you can only unlock guns and abilities through using COD points, the currency of the game.You can gain cod points in various ways, a great way is using either contracts, or the fun new wager matches, which basically allow you to gamble your points for more.Sadly, while the game has fixed glitches and errors from Modern warfare 2, such as Quick scoping, Continuing killstreaks and over powered weapons, Cod points do sometimes get on your nerves, as you have to buy absolutly everything, and I mean everything, this sometimes makes things no worth bothering to get. The maps are now definately not as camper friendly as in MW2, but the bad side is that while the maps are still large, there are lots of objects in the way, this makes almost impossible to get any value out of using sniper rifles, unless you use an ACOG sight, and even using that won't guarrentee you your money's worth.While it is majorly unsniper friendly, and cod points are sometimes annoying, its a solid multiplayer none the less.The last main piece of content is Zombies. I felt a bit dissapointed with zombies, the maps you are put in are not very friendly and are quite confusing, they should have included a simple map such as one like Nacht der untoten from World at War. Still, get a few friends together, and it has its moments, though its best to get a Hardened version of the game so that you can get the old classic zombie maps from the previous game.Overall, Black ops in its gameplay sense is the same as the last 3 games in the series and now it is starting to show its age, though the multiplayer is darn right addictive, so this is what I say.If your looking for a great game, go for World at War, if your looking for an addictive game, go for Black ops… Expand",

                "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.\n        \nSingle PlayerOverall good but short. way short, finished in about 5hours of playing over two days. I do run a lot but dang! MW2 took me at least almost a week. levels for the most part are beautiful but very linear. lot less open compared to MW2 which had that even if linear in design i still felt like i could explore and replay in a way different way, black ops no so much. the story was great and was probably the best in the series, but the levels that went with it felt anti climactic. the way they told the story in memories was part of this reason, right when something big was happening at the end of the level it would just fade out and i would be left thinking \"and it was just getting awesome.\" side things were less and not as fun, no climbing up ice walls or sliding down a rope upside down to stab a guy. sling shot was nice but was way early in the game and very easy and short. vehicles were good but definitely not as fun as the ones in MW2. Pacing was off though, a whole lot of action and a whole let down in things that set up the coming battles. swimming ten feet in nam wasn't as cool as riding a torpedo sub thing up to the bottom of an oil rig. Graphics were outstanding other than a cut scene with the SR-71. that scene in particular looked like a HD plane in flying in N64/PS1 space. but other than that minor complaint coming from a 3d artist the levels were great. the jungles were lush and the lighting was fantastic. swinging lamps with dynamic lighting being bounced around while the building shook from explosions really added to the feel. Sound was great with voice acting spot on, minus my personal thoughts of every time going \"haha that's Ice Cube and the avatar guy\" so overall fun and a good game but by no means i think did it live up to it's hype. glad i'm not a camper, i mean the ones who set up tents outside stores.which brings me to multiplayerOverall great. and different. i could spend all day comparing it to MW2 but i will due my best to only compare the things i noticed the most. yes kill streaks are harder to get which makes them more satisfying to get. but also a little less fun on the operating end. but a whole lot less annoying on the receiving end. at least i can shoot down that heli or that dog in the face. overall balance seems great with a couple stand out guns but you can just go buy it so no worries. customization is fun but i wish camo and reticles weren't all available once you unlock them. it makes the coolest camo way less of a badge of honor to sport. emblems are better at this but still lacking that, yeah i did that and got this and more just oh look what i bought. face paint as far as leveling up and getting more is the best at this i feel and facepaint is fun but wish it was more for gun stuff or more perks or something that effected the gameplay a bit more. the wager matches are a blast and a good change of pace when you are tired of core matches but the disconnected feel makes me not play them too often. yeah you get money but i get way more money just palying a couple good games of domination or HQ. now overall the game feels less hectic in multiplayer. something i kind of liked in MW2, it felt like war. this feels like an older multiplayer experience in actual gameplay. i want a good size nam battle going on online not the lack of jungle in the jungle level. the levels are varied and ok but overall feel very boxed. like i said feels like a dated multiplayer experience. now i am enjoying how it does have it's own unique feel and gameplay but i wouldn't say it stands out as the best. in my tops it might be around 6th or 7th. maybe lower i'd really have to think about that. non the less am enjoying it and playing it a lot mostly because it is new but i feel its staying power will fade with things like bloodlines coming out and next year with things like dead space 2, killzone 3, etc etc. so i give a 7 overall for both single and multiplayer. both get a pass but by no means are they on the honor roll… Expand",

I enjoy their games being that tupically they are more balanced. Though this game fixes alot of the game-breaking elements introduced into MW2 (not a tall mountain to climb as many know) it fails to come anywhere near COD4 and WaW. Treyarch made some much needed adjustments and removed alot of the frustrating elements that outright ruined MW2. Sadly they played it TOO safe and in the end made a bland game. I was very happy to see the unholy trinity of martyrdom, juggernaut, and stopping power removed completely. This could have been enough to make the online leaps and bounds more playable than MW2 but, put simply, the included perks are boring, recycled, and unimaginative. It was also refreshing to see Treyarch practice some sanity by removing dual-wielded shotguns (really Infinity Ward? REALLY??) and issuing major nerfs (handicaps) to the grenade launcher and assault rifles. Hit detection is as abysmal as any cod game so cant count them off there. the weapons are incredibly balanced each with a relatively different play-type leading to more diverse games where not everyone is using the same thing (I'm talking to you famas, m16, SCAR, .50cal, dual rangers). It was nice to see more than one semi-auto rifle but they are much too weak to compete in a fully automatic world. Another issue is snipers were pretty much written out when it came to map design and balancing. Sniper rifles are difficult at best and just dont pack enough punch to be useful. Sniper Players may find themselves snagging some assists but thats only if they can post up long enough to pick off ignorant and unaware players before getting gun down from behind by a newly spawned player. That brings me to BO's next downfall. The spawning is abysmal. You can game confidently knowing that you will have enemy players spawning behind you. around you, and sometimes even right next to you. Very frustrating when you journey to a quiet corner of a map to drop a carepackage or other dropped killstreak. There is a complete absence of a \"front\" so be prepared to scramble, keep moving, and watch your back (even if it placed securely onto the edge of the map). Moving to the customization. its safe to say Treyarch was intentionally vague and misleading on the amount of customization. im sure i was only one of many that were disappointed to see that you could not, in fact, change many aspects of your character. It was nice, however to see perks actually affect the way the character looks (ghost, flak jacket, lightweight, etc). Though some may be sold on adding a happyface to their reticle or sculpting male genitalia out of the hundreds of playercard symbols provided, one could not help be feel how absolutely superfluous it all was when there were guns, perks, and killstreaks to buy. The campaign was solid. it didnt break any ground but it was no more superior or inferior to the last 3 COD campaigns. Most dont purchase Cod for the campaign so i wont go into it The crown jewel that has come to be associated with Treyarch releases is the acclaimed Nazi Zombies. Treyarch has outdone itself again with much more complex maps and even 2 separate \"storylines\" You have the ww2 cast of characters from WaW and a new cast of which i will not disclose. The new cast is hilarious and the voice actors are excellent. Its much more challenging. Zombies fall out of the ceiling, leap through windows instead of climb, and there is even a new very dangerous breed of zombie of which ill let you discover for yourslelf. The mystery box moves much more often (averaging 4-5 uses before whisking off to a less defendable room). Treyarch also included a competitive top-down arcade zombie killer that is amazingly fun and good for hours of replay with up to a team of 4. Overall the game is solid and offers an amazing amount of content in terms of maps, zombies, killstreaks(trust that if this had been an infinity ward release you would be shelling out some extra dosh for alot of it). Though it seeks to fix what mw2 broke it just doesnt offer enough NEW items to make people drop MW2, and WaW to make the $60 switch. See you in two years treyarch, better luck next time.… Expand",

The bots are a nice touch. The story was cool enough; it captured a popular theme from those good old days (*cough* Manchurian *cough* Candidate *cough*). You can customize a lot about your character and weapons (well, some of them). You can create your own emblem (tho, the amount of phallic & pornographic imagery when the game first released expresses all too well what treasure there is to be gained in the US public education system).\r Now the things that were wrong: One would assume that realism would lend itself to the concept of a game based on the player assuming the part of a soldier operating with real-life military tactics rather nicely. Would've been the way I would've taken it. AK-47's, 74u's & MAC-11's easier to control on full-auto than an AUG or a FAMAS, let alone ANY of them being controllable on full auto. Primary weapon shotguns with a range of what seems to be 10' and not even mag modification attachments (look up the Ithaca 37, there were about a billion versions. Arguable the Stakeout was one specific version - still you can shoot something more than 10 friggin' feet away with it!). Dual-wielding any gun at all (again, maybe that was an action-movie concept). And, my favorite, snub-nosed pistols that become MORE accurate? Combine these realitively minor personal beefs, which probably only burned 2nd amendment enthusiasts, with the step back in graphics, the poor server quality (at least rurally), the low-quality maps which lack any type of cover or decent overlook spots, unbalanced options for successful character specs (they REALLY want you to use those SMG's, don't they), and the bugs & gliches (just tap the trigger if hipfiring, you'll hit dead-on almost everytime & with the small maps that practically force close-quarters, why ever ADS if you take one of the many preferred SMG's?), it really is a step back for the series from MW2 (the natural comparison).

Due to the fact that they have followed the same formula when creating the same single player, you know the one where it is packed full of cinematic sequences that get you pumped with adrenaline and makes you feel like a God (of CoD). But although most will enjoy the awesome single player it won't take more than a day to finish the campaign and the story plot is predictable but with a twist or two that you wont guess.Multiplayer? Well if you were lucky enough to get it at release date then you would probably have enjoyed it with an exception from the annoying matchmaking faults, which are fixed btw. But now that it has been out for a while people have the top weapons which trust me really does make a difference as the last two weapons have barely any recoil and have a crap load of damage which makes for a horrible experience for the lower levels. There is also the fact that the killstreaks area lot lower and a **** load more dangerous plus there is a perk which you can take that lets people get it even faster. Overall the Multiplayer has changed a lot by using credits but they have made the game revolve completely around money which takes out the chance to earn them which makes the game a little bit stingy, the whole Mutiplayer is unbalanced but there is simply know way to fix that, a lot of people are going to get annoyed and frustrated over the Multiplayer so I think Treyarch have let us down there.As for Zombies the thing has been revamped a bit with the modern feel and new maps, but the mode on a whole as stayed the same which is not good and the maps although nicely made are very hard to survive in, on the plus side though one map lets you play as JFK and Nixon and who wouldn't love that.

As is my standard way with any COD release, I play the campaign first just to get it out of the way. This is not why we buy this series its the online we want. However the offline campaign tends to give you an general overview of the production. The first thing that struck me was the drop in graphical quality from MW2, which I finally put down to a poor selection for the colour palette used in the majority of stages. The campaign for me dragged in the first half and just took to long for what play and content there was, the final half was completed easily in an hour which gave the feeling of the final production being rushed. But any Call Of Duty game will always be judged on its online game play. First impressions were good, but it soon starts to feel like MW2 with new maps and the levels with the still very poor colours are still there which lets it down. A good feature is that you can vote to replay or play the next map or random selection, this has meant I have been able to avoid the levels which are graphical unimpressive. The major down side of the online, connection problems, host problems, servers not being available or going down which is extremely annoying when you want to get a good evening of gaming in. Now, for the what I think is the pure genius revolution of this game over MW2 - Combat Training. This option is absolutely fantastic and redeems this game! Server problems, host problems, connection issues when playing online? No problem, fire up Combat Training and play bots on your favourite map. I actually enjoy this more than real online play, its so satisfying and more addictive than the real thing. To sum up, its overall a good game let down by a rushed and confusing campaign mode, and poor hosting online. Combat Training saves the day but once I reach the top rank once I will have had enough.

There has been 6 CoD's since this gen's platforms have been out, Treyarch has developed 4 of them (CoD2, 3, WaW, and BlOps) and they still haven't perfected it. I have to agree with some of the others who have written reviews, this game is very much a slightly dumbed down version of CoD: MW2. First complaint would be the graphics. Shades of gray and brown fill the screen with pasty and dull environments, my first thought was \"wow, this is ugly.\" Second, $59.99 USD for this game is an utter crime, the 4 to 6 hours of campaign you will pay is no where near that, but i know most, if not all of you, are purchasing this for the multiplayer, which brings me to my final point. Number three, the multiplayer is fun, yes, i kinda enjoyed it, but the set up is nothing but polished MW2 leftovers, in other words, same ole crap, different title. Game modes don't really feel any different from each other, and neither do the weapons. The first weapons they give you in every class aren't the best you can get, but are darn close to being the best, and on a side note, for realism sake, I about died laughing when I saw the stats for the Makarov (pistol), it had more \"power\" than the 1911, ha. But anyways back to the multiplayer. The points system is a joke, why should i be rewarded every time I lost a match? I was getting at least half the points the winning team was, I leveled up to level 13 in less than 2 hours of playing time. It was a rather casual experience to say the least. All in all I didn't hate the game, I had fun with the multiplayer, but not $60 of fun.

I can't really comment on Mw2's online play, but Black Ops online multiplayer is ADDICTIVE!!!!!!! Even if your like me and die more than you kill, you should still be found having an awesome time. Another perk is Zombies which may be one of the smartest things to do since it was so successful in World at War. It is cool to play by yourself, with a friend, or online. This is THE best game I have ever played and according to intel, mail, and notes from the game (won't play spoiler to you), you can be expecting a Call of Duty Black Ops 2 announcment pretty soon!!!… Expand"

                "Truly exceptional. [Jan 2006, p.109]", 
                "What really makes the difference, though, is that Animal Crossing: Wild World is one of the first games to take advantage of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, allowing players worldwide to travel to other players' towns.", 
                "An amazing gaming experience. It has something for everyone: fishing, bug hunting, philanthropy (i.e. donating fossils to the museum), epistolatory madness, costume design, music composition, empire building and much more.", 
                "The ultimate Animal Crossing: despite its familiarity, this retains the ability to charm your socks off. [Apr 2006, p.34]", 
                "With no big battles, mesmerizing graphics, or frustrating challenges, Animal Crossing plummets the player into a new, relaxed world, where your only concerns are to meet the animals, find all species of fish and bugs, excavate ancient fossils, and of course, pay your seemingly endless mortgage to Tom Nook.", 
                "Speaking of navigation, another reason this game is so wonderful is that every last thing you do can be done using your stylus. Typing, walking, drawing, organizing – it’s just a tap or stroke away.",

                "A game quite unlike any other, a game that is wonderfully Nintendo at heart; Animal Crossing: Wild World will either leave a lasting impression, becoming part of your daily routine or have you questioning what the fuss is all about right from the start.", 
                "It never feels limited, or that you've \"done everything\"; the game is designed in a such a dynamic and charming manner that while playing you're not only investing your efforts, but also being rewarded for coming back.", 
                "What Animal Crossing: Wild World does is an amazing job of pulling you into the experience. A majority of the game is crafted with so much authentic human precision, detail and personality that the end result is something that makes you feel inadequate if you don't return the same effort when actually playing.", 
                "Despite the familiarity, the longer you spend in your scaled-down village, the more you’re soothed into a gentle, constructive daydream which is every bit as charming as in all its other incarnations. [Jan 2005, p.89]", 
                "I'm playing this version through with, if you can't tell, my girlfriend, and the aspect of simply playing the game with others, either on the same cart, of across Wi-Fi, is a whole new experience, one absolutely fraught with joy, laughter and loveliness.", 
                "It is a game that doesn’t take much time to play making it perfect for traveling and short trips.", 
                "Unusual and delightful. You know you are hooked when you cannot wait to see what your furry friends are up to, or spend hours crafting letters or building the museum collection.", 
                "Wild World is more of an expansion than a sequel. The DS version adds online play and a camera that follows you instead of one that shifts from screen to screen. [Mar 2006, p.89]", 
                "I guarantee nine out of 10 fans of the original \"AC\" will be disappointed with this one. Oh, we'll still spend hours with it, sucked into its insanity, but this certainly isn't the sequel we were hoping for. [Jan 2005, p.132]", 
                "After three years, a major hardware shift and a hungry audience, Animal Crossing: Wild World doesn't add anything new to the great original formula.", 
                "There are no ogres to impale, no weapons (unless a fishing pole counts as a weapon), no panty-flashing fights between Amazons. Like your stoner brother, the game is a little too laid back for its own good, doesn't have any goals, and it farts like muffler-less Buick whenever it eats peanuts.", 
                "For the gamer that likes to live double or triple lives, or for an original Animal Crossing fan, this is a game to pick up. However, for the gamer that demands fast-paced action, storyline, and an imperative need for an ending, this may not be the best game to play."

                "The graphics and sound are fantastic, the story and gameplay are brilliant and the multiplayer aspects are just amazing. The additon of Forge and co-op gives the game a much longer life span than many other games. You couldn't find a better game for any console.", 
                "Halo 3 is the best Xbox 360 game to date. The single-player campaign and storyline are both very strong, but it's Forge and the Saved Films features that will likely go down in history as Bungie's crowning achievements. They've basically taken everything great about the series and improved upon it in every way, then added some amazing new features that we'll be using for years to come.", 
                "Halo 3 is the gaming equivalent of a Hollywood blockbuster. It's not going to revolutionise the genre - it's not meant to - it's meant to be great fun, which it is. Never lose sight of that. The visuals, guns, vehicles, enemies, set-pieces, musical score... they've all been cranked up to 11 to create an experience up there with the best sci-fi properties.", 
                "The online tear is a blast to play and with all the new bells and whistles they added to the game, you may not play anything else online for quite a while.", 
                "The game is definitely far superior to its predecessor and is just about on-par with the original, maybe even more so since it feels more complete.", 
                "Sure, no one aspect of the game is life-changing on its own, but perhaps the package as a whole is. [Dec 2007, p.116]", 
                "Between the ability to come up with your own bizarre custom modes and the theater mode, which records damn near everything you do with crystal clarity and allows you to play it back from multiple points of view, the worst thing you can say about Halo 3 multiplayer is that it's going to force you to buy an Elite 360 just for the sake of having more hard drive space.", 
                "While Halo 3 doesn't look as good as games like \"Gears of War\" and \"BioShock\" it makes up for that with superb lighting effects, an engaging storyline and a multiplayer mode that will be played countless times over.", 
                "It simply combines the best parts of Halo (wide-open, diverse environments) and Halo 2 (dual wielding weaponry), and throws a few new weapons, vehicles and enemies to the mix. The result is a thrilling and ultimately satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.", 
                "Halo 3 is the action game to buy this Fall, quite simply because it does exactly the same thing that the previous two have.", 
                "It's the addition of the Forge level editor and the saved films that give the game an even longer set of legs, legs that will probably keep you running at full speed until Bungie figures out where, exactly, to go from here.", 
                "The campaign, which is very good, is Halo 3's weakest point. It doesn't capture the cavalier spirit of the original Halo, but you'll still have fun playing through it. There's no first-person shooter on 360 that can equal Halo 3's blend of cinematic action, adrenaline-pumping shootouts, and male- (and female)-bonding gameplay. Look beyond the gameplay and you have a rich feature set unlike anything ever delivered in a videogame.", 
                "Halo 3 takes every positive aspect from the first two Halo games, perfects them, puts them in a shinier and better looking package, tosses in wonderful community-driven content for a console game, establishes some awesome environments, and does it so damn well it's impossible to not have fun while playing.", 
                "This last installment for Master Chief in the Halo trilogy isn't perfect, but it comes pretty close.", 
                "More weapons, more vehicles and some very exciting game modes which I expect and hope that future titles incorporate too. Has Bungie delivered on the hype? I most certainly think so.", 
                "Halo was remarkable in the ambition and innovation that made it so fresh, but the mighty number three doesn't have quite that same freshness - instead, it has a reassuring maturity to it, crafted as it is by a team who have learned from every mistake they've made and every word of feedback the community has offered over the years. Halo 3 is the best Halo has ever been, and you won't find a greater accolade than that.", 
                "Bungie was able to utilize the 360's hardware to provide not only a visual stunning masterpiece, but a great sounding one too.", 
                "Halo 3 gives a deeper, smoother and grander ride then ever before.", 
                "If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be \"solid\" – the weapons feel just right, the sounds represent impact perfectly, and the sound effects themselves are entirely suitable.", 
                "The conventional multiplay aspects would have left most reviewers a sweaty mess on their carpets, but Bungie's innovations have pushed the boundaries on not only what multiplay does, but what multiplayer is. Shooting doesn't seem to be the be all and end all, all of a sudden.", 
                "The story was excellent and the campaign was extremely exciting to go through. The online is awesome, although it needs some work on gametypes.", 
                "Halo 3 is the best game in the series. Not only that, it is the best console shooter ever. Yet, at the same time, it fails to feel as fresh as \"Halo 2\" did when it arrived. While \"Halo 2's\" dual-wielding revolutionised the Halo gameplay, Halo 3's equipment does no such thing. [Oct 2007]", 
                "Halo 3 is an excellent first-person shooter, and with it, Bungie ends its trilogy on a strong note.", 
                "Genre-defining. [Nov 2007, p.58]", 
                "On the one hand, the level design feels absolutely superb, showing the sort of versatility and pacing that awesome shooters are made of. On the other hand, this is exactly the reason why single-player feels so short and why it IS so short.", 
                "The bottom line is, online or off, Halo 3 is a game every 360 owner should at least try out", 
                "Clearly Bungie's efforts were focused on the multiplayer facets of this game; and that alone makes it worth owning.", 
                "The combination of the excellent campaign, tried and true multiplayer, and online co-op make this a game that shouldn't be missed by anyone.", 
                "Where lies the big innovation in the third iteration? It looks better, and plays about the same, but it doesn't take many chances-the \"forge\" system and the new custom games are excluded from matchmaking, and the neat theater option isn't really an upgrade to the gameplay. But still, we applaud you, for in giving us more of the same, you have given us exactly what we wanted.", 
                "Despite Halo 3's overall greatness, we can't help but feel somewhat let down by the narrative's lackluster conclusion (but stay tuned after the credits roll for a coda that hits just the right note).", 
                "The game's end sequence, to put it mildly, is an eight-car pileup. Fans of the series will recognize it as a poorly veiled swipe of a sequence in the original Halo, a challenge highlighted by a series of goofy circumstances and improbable level design meant to create an explosive end. The end result, however, is fairly absurd, as the whole shebang reeks of game developers wracking their brains to come up with the cleverest, most exciting finish, and shattering the fourth wall in the process.", 
                "The Forge and Theatre modes redefine what it is to make a game \"for the fans\", as they are substantial and influential additions to the game and have the potential to build Halo 3 even further then it has ever been before.", 
                "A few niggling flaws — or maybe just impossibly high expectations — keep Halo 3 from perfection. But on the whole, it’s a heartfelt and worthy conclusion to one of the most beloved video game series of all time.", 
                "Bungie has delivered an excellent Campaign mode, arguably the best multi-player experience on any platform and almost endless replay value. But Halo 3 scores most highly for artistic vision, capitalising on all of the series' greatest visual motifs.", 
                "Naturally, the game is highly detailed, and the transition to the current console generation has certainly been successful. But you can’t help but notice the amount of aliasing, and it really doesn’t suit Halo 3 in any way.", 
                "The campaign by itself offers a painfully mediocre experience. Halo 3 really shines in its multiplayer aspects, both Co-Op and competitive. Co-Op alters the campaign experience enough to marginalize the vast majority of its problems and bring you back time and again to play through with friends.", 
                "It’s the Halo sequel that fans have been demanding. And it’s the game that’s going to sell a lot of Xbox 360s.", 
                "Halo 3 may not fully live up to the obscene hype, but it certainly survives it.", 
                "Combat refined. Combat perfected. But not Combat evolved. [Nov 2007, p.98]", 
                "Navigating the environments with a controller isn't as intuitive as a mouse and keyboard setup, but with a bit of patience and some experimentation… well, Bungie has seen to it that Halo 3 will probably be the most played Xbox 360 game for at least the next year.", 
                "Single-player is too similar to what has come before to earn perfect marks, whereas all other aspects are worthy of such commendation. [Issue#25, p.72]", 
                "The war, as it was, has been won. [Nov 2007, p.70]", 
                "What it comes down to is that Halo 3 is still a great playing first-person shooter that manages to get just about everything right.", 
                "The trilogy ends with a title that doesn’t bring anything really new regarding the solo campaign, but maintains the fun and appealing gameplay that this series is known for. In the end, it’s on the multiplayer front that Halo 3 shines the most, with an overwhelming number of options and exemplary support by Bungie. [Oct 2007, p.55]", 
                "A phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy, offering an epic story that is more satisfying than the second game, action on a much bigger scale and a multiplayer section that has been improved from the immensely entertaining multiplayer of the second game.", 
                "Halo 3 is a fantastic game: a magnificent example of multiplayer gaming with an enjoyable side order of single-player, but it’s really hard to justify as being a true classic.", 
                "There's no denying how awesome the replay and Forge features are – but they're not the core of the game. Don't get me wrong, the single player campaign is very strong, the action is tight, and the AI is F.E.A.R.-killing. But for every positive, there was an area of the game that left me wanting more – the backtracking, the overly cheesy storyline, the underwhelming visuals. And multiplayer feels too much like a HD-version of Halo 2 with a few gadgets you can toss around.", 
                "The story just isn't put-together well enough, the graphics are disappointing, and the levels have you constantly running back and forth. Yes, if all of these things were rectified, the game would be spectacular. But they're not.", 
                "Halo 3 is fun, and its Forge and Theater modes will provide hours of multiplayer entertainment, but nothing could've prepared us for our slight feeling of disappointment. The game's far too reliant on old gameplay tricks and recycled levels, and it really lost its narrative power.", 
                "Billions of hours are destined to be lost online as it slowly takes over the world because the multiplayer alone covers the retail price, and features such as Forge and Saved Film only further justify the purchase.", 
                "While Halo 3 doesn't force upon the player another tortuous romp through The Library, it does feature an agonizing substitute complete with seemingly endless waves of Flood victims. This--along with a handful of recycled locales in the final third of the game--is a lack of ingenuity in level design that sticks out sorely amid a slate of superbly conceived features.", 
                "Halo 3 will not revolutionize the first person shooter, nor is it taking the Halo franchise to anyplace really new. What it does do is deliver the penultimate Halo experience with improved graphics and tons of MP features.", 
                "An interesting campaign, spectacular if played in cooperative, a consistent multiplayer format with a great sense of community, but let down by some bugs and ambiguous design decisions.", 
                "Halo 3 is \"Halo 2\" with somewhat better graphics. That’s all you really need to know. If you loved \"Halo 2,\" you will feel just the same about Halo 3. If you played \"Halo 2\" and couldn’t figure out what all the fuss was about, Halo 3 is not the revelatory experience that will change your view of the series forever.", 
                "The fight might well be finished but like the end to any war, Halo 3 isn't pretty. One of the top multiplayer experiences available on any console (as expected) redeems a largely disappointing Campaign, but even that doesn't change the fact that the 'Xbox mascot' baton has passed to Fenix and his crew of COGs.", 
                "The single player campaign is not anywhere near as compelling or as epic as is billed. Anyone new to Halo probably won't see what all the fuss is about, completely confused as to why this third installment is so important to so many people. It's good, and there's enough here to make for a memorable game, but how memorable depends mostly on how invested you are in the franchise already.", 
                "There is still a lot of fun to be had with Halo 3, mostly for veterans of the series, just don't try to convince me that this is the end all be all of FPS gaming. Gamers like myself who have already seen and played \"the future\" will likely dismiss this old-school gameplay and move on to the far more visionary titles that are just around the corner.", 
                "Another disappointment is the often-clumsy ally AI. While the enemy units display proficient level intelligence, your marine companions often struggle to cope with the enemy onslaught. This is never more evident as when you’re riding alongside a CPU driver in a Warthog; they drive so erratically you half expect them to crack open a crate of Carling midway through the mission.", 
                "The best thing I can say is that if you never really cared about the single player game in the first place, you can expect to have a great time with Halo 3 for years to come. If however, you are looking to “Finish the Fight”, and don’t plan on paying for Xbox Live Gold, you would be best served to wait for a price drop or two… or three."

For those who say that Halo 3 was over-hyped, in my opinion that is why it is such an important game. 2007 was a fantastic year for games, with titles such as Bioshock, Mass Effect, Call of Duty 4 and Grand Theft Auto 4 being released, but above all of these, Halo 3 was the first game to become a really competitive art form. The fact that it made more money in 48 hours than any film or music album is a really impressive feat, and in my opinion it was the first game to really prove that gaming was more than just the preserve of overweight, nerdy teenagers in their bedrooms.

Sure, the story was a little hard to follow at times, and I did get annoyed that it seemed that you were the only capable fighter on the battle field, and yet even on normal, I found myself time and time again being killed by the simple fact that there were sooooo many people trying to tear my face off at once.

While this might work against certain enemies, I found that really you only want to do that if the baddies happen to get separated, otherwise they will gangrape you. Overall, I was alright with the ending for the most part, up until they showed that somehow the portal closed just as the ship got halfway through it, allowing Arbiter through but leaving Master Chief and Cortana behind.

Upon arriving in the town York is greeted by town sheriff George Woodman and his deputy Emily Wyatt, who brief him on the murder and lead him to the crime scene. York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver asides to \"Zach\", an alternate personality congruent with the player. Over the course of his investigation, York has opportunities to touch the lives of many of the town's colorful personalities and intervene in their personal crises, often brought on by the sudden and brutal murder in their midst, to earn rewards and further his understanding of the case. As he unearths more and more mysteries and the killer continues to roam, the town's dark past slowly comes to light.Deadly Premonition's plot and setting are strongly influenced by the American television show Twin Peaks, and numerous allusions and thematic links can be found within the game, and Master Cheif dies in space.… Expand",

                "The graphics have been improved, the physics have been improved, more cars and tracks have been added and there is even a B-Spec mode that lets you manage a racing team and a photo mode that lets you take ultra realistic photographs of your cars and print them using an Epson printer. It’s hard to believe but they’ve done it again.", 
                "Its biggest strength is the realistic handling. You feel every nuance of the car's movements, weight shifts and suspension, particularly with a Driving Force Pro steering wheel. This is a peerless driving simulation that will test even professional drivers.", 
                "After sinking nearly 20 hours into GT4, I'm still nowhere near seeing everything it has to offer. [Apr 2005, p.98]", 
                "Without a doubt one of the most gorgeous videogames of this generation. Gran Turismo 4 is a masterpiece and there's no two ways about it.", 
                "10 / 10 / 9 / 10 - 39 platinum  [Jan 2005]", 
                "The best racing simulator ever made. That goes for all platforms and systems back to the beginning of time - GT4 is simply the best ever. The cars are amazingly detailed, the courses rich and diverse, and the amount of things to do in the game is impressively overwhelming.", 
                "Car enthusiasts and racing fans rejoice!  Gran Turismo 4 goes beyond our expectations to deliver a racing game that’s destined to become a genuine classic and the main reason fans of this genre will not see any daylight anytime soon.", 
                "Despite the fact that it plays just like its previous incarnations, the ballooned number of cars and the sheer amount of things to do easily makes this version the best of the bunch.", 
                "The definitive racing game on the PlayStation 2 or any other console.  It contains a degree of realism that is unrivaled, and it mixes that well with some of the best graphics that I have seen in a game.", 
                "Beautiful to look at, it's as rewarding as ever to play and, judging by the attention to detail that has been lavished on it, it's the most lovingly-created game ever. The chances are that you'll fall in love with it too, as only people who are obsessed with cars can fall in love with inanimate and soulless objects.", 
                "It is the best looking, best driving game (even if the racing is pretty ordinary) out there.", 
                "In a straight line the SLR feels like it has warp engines, and the feeling of real power is unlike anything I've seen in a racing game before. Burnout 3 and Need for Speed do a good job of scaring you with speed, but GT4 is still the only car sim to date that's done a convincing job of putting you behind a 5.4 liter V8.", 
                "There's no doubt that this game absolutely kills everything else around in terms of graphics, sound effects, and force feedback. The license tests, circuits, missions, hundreds of cars, and dozens of tracks all add up to what is still one hell of an addictive racing game... The only problem with GT4 being the perfect \"GT3\" is that after four years we were still hoping for more.", 
                "And while GT4 is not the massive leap from GT3 some were expecting, the sheer depth and variety of cars and tracks, great physics model and outstanding extras make it by far the best car game available on any system.", 
                "If GT4 will be your first venture into sim racing, hold on, strap in and protect any valuable reproductive organs, as you’ll be blown away. It pushes the boundaries of realism and sim racing, while retaining the essential core of the franchise that has been built over the last 8 years. You won’t find a better value.",

                "The greatest driving game ever. On any console, computer, or arcade cabinet, ever. Even with all the problems, nothing even comes close to matching the sheer adrenaline GT4 offers when you're chucking a 700bhp beast around one of the game's beautifully crafted courses. As a game, GT4 is staggeringly huge, looks and sounds amazing, and features so many cars you're unlikely to ever see them all. [JPN Import]", 
                "Some professional race drivers even use the incredibly life-like tracks in this game to prepare themselves for the real thing.", 
                "Not a huge leap from the previous version, but definitely a finely tuned game.", 
                "If you truly appreciate cars, though, and wanted to get just a glimpse of what it would be like to be behind the wheel of an exotic sports car or a Grand Prix racer, then GT4 will definitely deliver everything that you’re looking for and more.", 
                "The depth of the game, the amazing eye candy, the attention to detail and the gameplay are all top notch. When you get into it it’s a hard game to put down.", 
                "A fabulously executed game that remains a consistent joy to play for many, many moons. But it lacks innovation. [March 2005, p.120]", 
                "The control is simply phenomenal with the Logitech Driving Force Pro... A force feedback wheel where it pushes against you as you go into a turn at high speeds is just spot on.", 
                "The most involving driving experience ever. Even without the promised improvements (online play, better AI) it still manages to impress and will offer gameplay for months. The photo mode is a blast. [Mar. 05]", 
                "No other game comes anywhere close to replicating what it feels like to lay down two streaks of rubber in a '69 GT40 when the green flag drops, or hit 200 mph on the back straight at Le Sarthe. There are few games that can draw you in so completely that you forget you're playing a game in the first place, and this is one of them.", 
                "It's as thrilling a drive as it's has ever been and just unlocking the decent motors will take you days of play - then you'll never tire of trying to shave seconds from your lap times. GT4 occupies the same place in our hearts today as \"GT3\" did in 2001. [PSM2]", 
                "The use of lighting, reflections and shadows give the cars and tracks an ultra realistic look and an illusion of depth that just hasn’t been present in other racers. One caveat to this huge leap in graphical prowess though is that by pushing the PS2 to levels thought incapable of the system, there is a glitch that arises, called \"stuttering\" by most that’ve seen it.", 
                "The visuals are simply stunning, and you will be left wondering how the PS2 is capable of producing something some beautiful. The endless customization features and racing types will always leave you with something to do as well.", 
                "Yet again the series fails to become a proper racing game, with its rigid car physics and lack of decent opponents to face off against, but it’s still a fantastic and lengthy game in its own right.", 
                "No other racer – if not game, period – offers more depth and replayability than Gran Turismo 4 does, despite itself, sometimes.", 
                "Logitech has done a lot to help out with this with its new force feedback steering wheel. With a full 900 degrees of rotation, the wheel will fight you around turns, and gives gamers the best possible control interface for this masterpiece of a racing simulator. I can’t imagine playing GT4 without it.", 
                "If you can find the dedication to truly reap the enjoyment out of Gran Turismo, it’s every bit as addictive as the other games are. Racing perfection it is not, but it’s pretty close.", 
                "It’s a great game, as long as you aren’t expecting more than cars, cars, and more cars... The big thing that kept us down is the frame rate issue, which we both ended up agreeing was the major drag about this game.", 
                "Polyphony Digital delivers the most comprehensive and realistic simulation racing experience that the market has ever seen, it’s just a shame that the same boat and RV show has begun to run its course.", 
                "Unsurpassed, automotive beauty. The best driving game on PS2. [Jan 2007, p.106]", 
                "Even with its lackluster Arcade Mode, and the lack of online play, Gran Turismo still conveys what it has always been known for: The Drive of Your Life. There is no question that this is the most expansive racing title available.", 
                "Flawlessly paced progression keeps you playing for leaner lap times; a newfound sense of speed makes each race seem like protracted suicide; and down-to-the-nuts-and-bolts details assure authenticity--as the box says, this is the drive of your life.", 
                "We all fell in love with GT the first time out because it was so unprecedented, but on your fourth visit, you'll really wish the damn thing would evolve and live up to its potential. Still, it's riveting racing, it has its own undeniable charms. [JPN Import; March 2005, p.68]", 
                "It may be short on innovation, which is surprising with close challengers like Konami's \"Enthusia\" and Microsoft's \"Forza\" in the pipeline, but racing enthusiasts won't be disappointed.", 
                "It's also a tiny bit dry for our tastes. We prefer laying rubber, doing donuts, and crashing into exploding oil tankers to finesse driving and engine tinkering, but that's just us.", 
                "Represents the very pinnacle of PS2 racing games and lord only knows how long we'll have to wait for the next installment. Get it, race it and love it... One of the most comprehensive games of the last four years.", 
                "The emphasis on improved graphics, realism and vehicle/track variety come at the expense of a missing online component, better AI for the CPU drones and the return of the dreaded license tests. The good overwhelmingly outweighs GT4’s handful of tolerable negatives though.", 
                "Combining the best in graphics, physics and sound, Gran Turismo 4 is nothing short of breathtaking.", 
                "The AI is still shocking but we see it as a game that you buy to race cars you can't afford not a game you buy to race AI drivers with brains.", 
                "The only reason this game isn't perfectly fun is because it does once again leave us wanting more, and in that I am referring to online play.", 
                "GT4 resets the benchmark for driving simulations, it’s not perfect but by definition we never expect a GT game to be.", 
                "There's not a game I can call to mind that comes anywhere near Gran Turismo 4 in terms of lifespan. Pound for playtime it must be the cheapest game ever made; the career mode is huge.", 
                "No question, every game in the series has felt great, but this one is in another league. [Apr 2005, p.58]", 
                "Replays are like the FMVs of bygone years, cars sparkling with lensflare as they screech around a corner, just before you slyly knock them out of position and take the first place. Now all of your road delinquency can be recorded in some of the best graphics available in gaming today.", 
                "The basic “buy, race, upgrade, race, buy, and repeat” routine is still there. There is no damage, no online, and the soundtrack is questionable. However, everything else so close to perfect, it’s hard to resent these shortcomings.", 
                "Though it suffers from a curious lack of evolution in terms of some of its central aspects, most notably its racing AI, when GT4 works to its strengths, it delivers like few games of this console generation.", 
                "No game on the PS2, sadly, features slower load times than Gran Turismo 4. So when playing—or rather, getting ready to play GT4, you might as well have some refreshments nearby.", 
                "The game is massive. I could radically estimate that unlocking just a small tip of this iceberg could take around 100 hours.", 
                "While the game excels at being a simulator, it falters a bit in being enjoyable. The game can feel a bit boring at times.", 
                "It may be a long full game, but other racing games on the market are faster and more action packed.", 
                "Crash damage is also something we’ve been clamoring for. As it stands now, running into another car has all the impact of throwing a marshmallow against a pillow. It just doesn’t make sense for a title that invests so heavily in realism to let you hit a brick wall going 120 and then drive away.", 
                "It does essentially everything that \"GT3\" does, but more. More cars, more tracks, better physics, better graphics, and better sound. Likewise, the combination of force feedback steering and Nurburgring makes for a potent combination. On the other hand, the \"wow factor\" that came with the original \"GT3\" isn’t here with GT4.", 
                "An absolute orgy of burning rubber with 700 cars and 50 tracks... Next time we see GT roll up, pray for the ability to take it for an online spin, but for now, it's everything else you hoped Gran Turismo 4 would be. [JPN Import]", 
                "If it weren’t for the fact that simply picking up the controller makes you by far the smartest racer on the course, GT4 would be perilously close to being the finest, most serious racing game ever made. [Feb 2005, p.8]", 
                "Sure it may be \"the\" racing game but it's still \"just\" a racing game. It doesn't cover any new ground - literally.", 
                "GT4 has more limitations than previous games on what you can and can't do, too many menus locked until you'll reached certain criteria.", 
                "The AI is still taking the piss rather than pumping the lifeblood as it should be... After four games, it's shocking to discover that the AI cars still follow a clear line around each track, heartlessly cut back in front of you even when it's obvious you'll hit them as a result, ram your back end and allow you to crawl around the inside of them on corners you have no right to overtake on by using them as buffers.", 
                "There is no damage in Gran Turismo 4. This to me was a colossal disappointment. It’s not like I was expecting it, but this is supposed to be the real driving simulator... not the real bumper-car driving simulator... There are absolutely ZERO consequences for slamming into another car around a corner or brushing a barrier.", 
                "While GT4 aims for realism, it occasionally falls short. Competitors drive like mindless automatons, seemingly unaware of your existence.

I believe it is quite simply the layout that makes this game so special. The world map containing every dealership, race course and race event is a fantastic idea and I am still yet to see a game layout that can live up to it. Of course though, a game is not all about the layout, it's about actual gameplay, which GT4 also nails. It was comfortably the most advanced racing game for a number of years and got the very best out of an ageing console. Another thing I love about this game is the rate of progression and it's sheer length. A lot of racing games allow you to jump into some of the world's fastest cars almost right from the off, whereas others take so long before you get to drive anything good that it almost takes the fun out of it. GT4 gets the balance perfect. The way you have to start by earning all of your racing licenses and gradually working your way up to unlock different types of car for different types of races is something that makes this game amazing. It is a game that is incredibly challenging to complete to 100% and that is another reason why I love it so much. Easily the best game I've ever played. A solid 10/10… Expand",

First of all, the game is beautiful, the car list is much improved over GT3, etc. Now maybe it's just me, but the AI has seemed to have gotten worse. This of course is exacerbated by two key things: the increase in rolling start races, and the horrible changes to the rally mode. Let's start with the first. The Gran Turismo I'm going to try not to rehash everything said. First of all, the game is beautiful, the car list is much improved over GT3, etc. Now maybe it's just me, but the AI has seemed to have gotten worse. This of course is exacerbated by two key things: the increase in rolling start races, and the horrible changes to the rally mode. Let's start with the first. The Gran Turismo series generally has two types players: those who mod their cars and prefer to race against their own times and be so far ahead of the CPU that you can lap them in a two-lap race. The other type is the kind that prefers to have a really challenging race, where any mistake will cost them the race as they are maybe just a little undermatched to the CPU, but their driving skills are far superior. The problem is that the rolling start races, which of course always have the CPU \"Ringer\" at the front are ridiculous, and they force the user to seriously mod their cars way above the class they're racing in just to be able to catch up to the ringer, which, incidentally, is even faster in this game.Take for example one of the classic car challenges, which is a series race. I was in a 650-700 hp Chevelle SS, lightened, all drivetrain upgrades, etc. On the Nurburgring they had a rolling start. By the time I reached the start line so that I could fully accelerate (they limit you to 50 initalliy), the rest of the pack was right in front of me, while the '67 Cobra with 400 hp was 7-8+ seconds in front by the first turn. I was never actually able to pass him, due in part to the other CPU cars battering into me numerous times and cutting me off in the early part of the track. This is crappy for an individual race, but then in the context of a series, it's even worse. If my car is upgraded so that I can make up 8-15 sec. diff. from the start of a rolling race, then what happens when it's a standing start. I am way way ahead of everybody. So you either have races where you'll never catch up, or where you could sit at the start while the CPU does 2 laps, and still beat them. Of course, the ringer has also been tinkered with, and unfairly so. In this same series, the first standing start I was way ahead from the beginning. In the second standing start race, the ringer shot out to a 5 sec. lead going into the first turn, and then accelerated about two times faster as before. Total crap. Also, they completely ruined the fun of the rally mode because they are too lazy to do a damage model. So, since yes, damage is important in all racing and especially rallying, they impose a 5 sec. penalty (where you're limited to 31 mph for 5 sec.) any time the front half of your car touched the wall or the CPU. Now I might be able to deal with this, except that the CPU driving is so horrible that many times you'll hit something b/c he cuts you off or any other such nonsense. Additionally, the CPU gets no penalties. I can't tell how much fun it was for me when I was drifting around a turn and the CPU (following a normal line, not drifting) plowed into my side three times in the turn as it drove through me, and as my car spun off balance, I knicked his bumper and was rewarded with a 5 sec. penalty. Sweet. My other big gripe is that contrary to what one critic said about driving medium range cars for a while, that's BS. He obviously didn't play the very first rally, with an Easy difficulty which you only need your B (first) license for, and you get a 760hp Cadillac Cien for winning. Also, b/c of the Used Car Showrooms, you can start off with a much nicer car right from the start than if you were forced to buy new. In all, loads of fun, but there are some extremely frustrating problems. Props on the inclusion of city tracks in the rally mode.… Expand",

Nurburgring 24 hour endurance race?!! The only way I'm doing that is having a go for about 4-5 hours a day and then leave it paused overnight! At least the cars you win are not randomly chosen.

So many people complain about the car damage. Have people played NFS: High Stakes? In simulation, it's pain in the butt to fix your car after every race. AI racers are good racers with precision, but rather dumb when it comes to competiting. Only one mode that I miss is online mode.
